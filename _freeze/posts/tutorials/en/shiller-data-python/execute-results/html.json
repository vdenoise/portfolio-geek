We will use the requests library for HTTP requests and the pandas library for data manipulation. For visualization, we will use the Matplotlib library with the Pacoty stylesheet to create a chart comparing nominal equity returns, real equity returns, and real GDP growth.\n\n## Downloading Shiller's Data\n\nFirst, we need to import the required libraries and download the data using an HTTP request:\n\nThis code below downloads the Excel file from Shiller's website, directly into memory, and reads it into a pandas DataFrame.\n:::\n\n\n\n## Downloading Maddison Project GDP Data\n\n\n\n## Cleanup and Columns Renaming\n\n\n\n## Visualizing the Data with Matplotlib and Pacoty\n\n::: {.content-visible when-profile=\"website\"}\nNext, we will create a chart comparing the nominal equity returns, real equity returns, and real GDP growth using Matplotlib and the Pacoty.\nLet's start with a first sanity check on the data.\n:::\n\n\n![Dataframe](shiller-data.png)\n\n::: {.content-visible when-profile=\"website\"}\nThis code snippet creates a chart with a logarithmic scale, comparing nominal equity returns, real equity returns, and real GDP growth over time.\n:::\n\n## Long Term Equity Returns\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Long term equity returns vs CPI](shiller-data-python_files/figure-revealjs/long-term-return-output-1.png){#long-term-return}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.content-visible when-profile=\"website\"}\nThe resulting chart demonstrates the power of compounded returns and the equity risk premium that has rewarded long-term shareholders.
