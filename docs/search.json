Historical volatility, by referencing past price data, offers insights into the market’s perception of risk.

A high volatility implies higher risk, which often translates to higher returns.\nPortfolio Management: Volatility helps in diversification by understanding how volatile an asset is compared to others in the portfolio.\nDerivatives Pricing: It is indispensable in options pricing. Models like Black-Scholes employ historical volatility to estimate an asset’s future risk.\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Assessment: Enables us to quantify the risk and potential variation in returns for any given asset.\nInvestment Decisions: Guides investors on whether the asset’s risk matches their risk appetite.\nBenchmarking Performance: Facilitates comparisons with historical norms to identify unusual market behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical volatility measures how much the price of a stock varies over a period.

    "text": "Understanding the Sharpe Ratio\n\nWhat is the Sharpe Ratio?\nThe Sharpe Ratio is a financial measure used to evaluate the return of an investment compared to its risk. The key formula behind this ratio is:\n\\[\nSharpe Ratio = \\frac{R_p - R_f}{\\sigma_p}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n(R_p) is the expected return of the portfolio\n(R_f) is the risk-free rate (such as Treasury yield)\n(_p) represents the standard deviation of the portfolio’s excess return, symbolizing the risk\n\nBy defining how much excess return you are achieving for every unit of risk, the Sharpe Ratio helps you make informed investment decisions.\n\n\nKey Benefits and Limitations\nOne cannot ignore the advantages of using Sharpe Ratio:\n\nAssessing Performance: Easily compare different investments by their risk-adjusted returns.\nIdentifying Efficient Portfolios: Helps in finding portfolios that offer higher returns for a certain risk level.\nStandardization: Offers a common measure across various asset classes.\nRisk Management: Encourages evaluating risk alongside returns.\n\nHowever, it’s not without limitations:\n\nAssumes Normal Distribution: Returns are assumed to be normally distributed, which is not always the case.\nSingle Period Measure: Does not account for changing risk profiles over multiple periods.\nSensitivity to Risk-Free Rate: Results can vary based on the risk-free rate used.\nRisk Measurement: Standard deviation might not reflect all types of risks.\n\n\n\nHow to Calculate the Sharpe Ratio\nThe calculation steps for the Sharpe Ratio involve:\n\nGather historical return data over the desired period.\nDetermine the risk-free rate (government bonds or Treasury yields).\nCompute the standard deviation of the investment’s excess returns.\nUse the formula to calculate the Sharpe Ratio.\n\nLet’s move to some Python examples to see this in action."

    "text": "Analising QQQ vs. SPY through a Sharpe Ratio lens\n\nHistorical Price Data of QQQ and SPY\nUnderstanding how QQQ (NASDAQ-100) and SPY (S&P 500) performed over the last five years is always a good starting point. This visualization shows their performance trends and helps to lay the groundwork for further analysis.\n\n\nCode\n%%capture\nimport yfinance as yf\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Fetch historical price data for QQQ and SPY\ntickers = [\"QQQ\", \"SPY\"]\ndata = yf.download(tickers, start=\"2018-01-01\", end=\"2023-12-31\")['Adj Close']\n\n# Plot the data\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\ndata.plot()\nplt.title('Historical Price Data: QQQ vs. SPY')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Adjusted Close Price')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnualized Returns of QQQ and SPY\nNow, let’s compare the annualized returns of QQQ and SPY over the same time period. This helps to evaluate the consistency and average performance of each fund on an annual basis.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate annualized returns\nannualized_returns = (((data.iloc[-1] / data.iloc[0]) ** (1 / 5)) - 1) * 100\n\n# Plot the annualized returns\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\nannualized_returns.plot(kind='bar')\nplt.title('Annualized Returns: QQQ vs. SPY (in %)')\nplt.xlabel('ETF')\nplt.ylabel('Annualized Return (in %)')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical Volatility of QQQ and SPY\nTo understand the risk associated with each ETF, we will plot their historical volatility. This is computed as the standard deviation of returns over the last five years, highlighting periods of higher volatility.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate historical volatility\nvolatility = data.pct_change().std() * (252 ** 0.5) * 100 # Annualized standard deviation\n\n# Plot historical volatility\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\nvolatility.plot(kind='bar')\nplt.title('Historical Volatility: QQQ vs. SPY  (in %)')\nplt.xlabel('ETF')\nplt.ylabel('Annualized Volatility (in %)')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating Excess Returns of QQQ and SPY\nTo move towards the Sharpe Ratio, let’s calculate the excess returns of QQQ and SPY by subtracting the risk-free rate (say, 4% per annum for example) from their respective returns. This sets the stage for understanding how much return is gained relative to a risk-free investment.\n\n\nCode\nrisk_free_rate = 0.04\n\n# Calculate excess returns\nexcess_returns = data.pct_change() - risk_free_rate / 252\n\n# Plot the excess returns\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\nexcess_returns.plot()\nplt.title('Excess Returns: QQQ vs. SPY')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Excess Return')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSharpe Ratios for QQQ and SPY\nNow, let’s calculate and display the Sharpe Ratios for QQQ and SPY. This provides a visual representation of their risk-adjusted performance, giving immediate insight into which asset class, fund or ETF has delivered better returns relative to the risks taken.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate Sharpe Ratios\nsharpe_ratio = excess_returns.mean() / excess_returns.std() * (252 ** 0.5)\n\n# Plot the Sharpe Ratios\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\nsharpe_ratio.plot(kind='bar')\nplt.title('Sharpe Ratio: QQQ vs. SPY')\nplt.xlabel('ETF')\nplt.ylabel('Sharpe Ratio')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRolling Sharpe Ratios for QQQ and SPY\nObserving the rolling Sharpe Ratios over a 12-month window provides enhanced insight into how risk-adjusted performance has changed over time under different market conditions.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate rolling Sharpe Ratios\nrolling_sharpe = (excess_returns.rolling(window=252).mean() / excess_returns.rolling(window=252).std()) * (252 ** 0.5)\n\n# Plot rolling Sharpe Ratios\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\nrolling_sharpe.plot()\nplt.title('Rolling 12-Month Sharpe Ratio: QQQ vs. SPY')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Rolling Sharpe Ratio')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing Cumulative Sharpe Ratios of QQQ and SPY\nLastly, let’s compare the cumulative Sharpe Ratios of QQQ and SPY against a designated benchmark (e.g., a broader market index). This helps to gauge how well each ETF has outperformed relative to overall market trends.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate cumulative Sharpe Ratios\ncumulative_sharpe = ((excess_returns.expanding(min_periods=252).mean()) / excess_returns.expanding().std()) * (252 ** 0.5)\n\n# Plot cumulative Sharpe Ratios\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\ncumulative_sharpe.plot()\nplt.title('Cumulative Sharpe Ratio: QQQ vs. SPY')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Cumulative Sharpe Ratio')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScatter Plot of Risk vs. Return\nFinally, we will create a scatter plot of risk versus return, plotting the expected returns of QQQ and SPY against their respective standard deviations. This visual representation underscores the efficient frontier concept, providing a comprehensive view of optimal risk-return trade-offs.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate expected returns and standard deviations\nexpected_returns = annualized_returns\nrisk = volatility\n\n# Scatter plot of risk vs. return\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\nplt.scatter(risk, expected_returns, label=['QQQ', 'SPY'])\nfor i, txt in enumerate(risk.index):\n    plt.annotate(txt, (risk[i], expected_returns[i]))\nplt.title('Risk vs. Return: QQQ vs. SPY')\nplt.xlabel('Annualized Volatility')\nplt.ylabel('Annualized Return')\nplt.show()"

    "text": "Defining our Investable Universe\nFirst and foremost, we need to define our Investable Universe i.e. the set of asset classes that we will allow in our portfolio.\nMany investors would typically think about single stocks, but on my side, I am typically looking at well diversified portfolios. Moreover, I am typically looking Long Term Investing, and as such, Indices, diversified portfolio or ETFs are in focus for me.\nSpeaking about asset classes, we need some ETFs to analyse!\n\n“Important: Please bear in mind this article if purely for pedagogical purpose and should by no mean be understood as a recommendation or advice. Investing brings risk and in particular risk of loss of capital. I have no intention to recommend anything! I will follow among others this recent article in US News{% fn 7%} and ETF.com{% fn 8%} as sources of inspiration to identify relevant ETFs.”\n\n\nEquity\nLet’s start with various Equity sub-asset classes:\n\nIVV: iShares Core S&P 500 ETF representing US Equity Large Cap\nSCHA: Schwab U.S. Small-Cap ETF representing US Equity Small Cap\nIJH: iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF representing US Equity Mid Cap\nSCHD: Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF representing US Equity Dividend (ie US stocks which are deemed to pay higher dividends)\nVTI: Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF representing US Equity, with all market cap included\nVXUS: Vanguard Total International Stock ETF representing World ex-US equities\nEEM: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF representing the Emerging Market Equities\n\n\n\nFixed Income\nLet’s add Fixed Income, which would typically aim to reduce the overall portfolio’s volatility:\n\nAGG: iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETFrepresenting the entire US Bond market\nGOVT: iShares U.S. Treasury Bond ETF representing the performance of US Government Bonds\nVCLT: Vanguard Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF representing the Investment Grade USD denominated bonds.\n\n\n\nAlternative Assets\nLet’s add 2 additional asset classes, Gold and Commodities:\n\nGLD: SPDR Gold Trust representing the price of **Gold\nPDBC: Invesco Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF** which will represent the performance of the Broad Commodities asset class\n\nEverything in the above is denominated in US Dollars, this will make our life easier in what follows, ie we will not need any currency conversion, which is always a bit painful in the process."

    "text": "Estimate risk and return\nIn Markowitz 1952, the optimal portfolio is obtained as a function of expected returns and expected risks of the portfolio. This takes a strong assumption that we have a “crystal ball”, or at least access to a predictive model, which at this stage is well beyond this article.\nFor this first example, we will rely on historical parameters estimation, which precisely means that we expect the past to be a good prediction of what might happen in the future.\n\nVolatility\nThere are many ways to estimate the volatility, and I will only cover the simplest approach.\nWe have access to daily close prices of the ETFs, hence we could look at the standard deviation of daily returns. In theory this would utilise most of the data we have access to, which is a good thing. In practice, and especially when looking at asset classes which can be observed with an 8 to 12 hours time difference which might lead the “sample volatility” to become inconsistent between 2 asset classes. This is even more important for estimating the correlation.\nPractitioners often use weekly returns to alleviate this issue, and we will do the same here, and as such calculate the returns using a resampled time series. To calculate the annualized volatility requires an additional factor in this case the square root of 52. Why this?\nVolatility is essential to option traders, and when pricing options, practitioners often model asset prices as Wiener processes(number of weeks in a year) 3. The variance of a Wiener process is proportional to the time, and the volatility is the square root of the the variance, which gives us that to convert standard deviation of weekly returns into an annualized figure, we need to multiply our results by the square root of the number of weeks in a year.\n\n\nCode\nweekly_returns = df.resample(\"W\").last().pct_change()\n((weekly_returns.std()*math.sqrt(52)*100).sort_values()).plot.bar();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs one could have guessed, on the left of the chart above, we can find the low volatility asset classes (e.g. Government Bonds, Investment Grade Bonds), whereas on the right we have high volatility asset classes (Mid Cap and Small Cap Equities)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is a critical risk metric for investors. It quantifies the largest peak-to-trough decline in an investment’s value over a specified period, providing insights into potential losses during market downturns. Understanding MDD helps investors gauge the risk profile of their investments and make informed decisions.\n\n\n\nIn today’s volatile markets, comprehending the MDD of assets like QQQ (a NASDAQ ETF) and SPY (a S&P 500 ETF) can bring some help in grasping the risk of a particular asset. Such analysis provides a comparative view of the resilience of individual stocks versus market indices, aiding in better portfolio management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximum Drawdown is an important measure of investment risk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis blog aims to introduce Python enthusiasts and portfolio managers to the concept of Maximum Drawdown, demonstrating how to calculate and visualize it using Python libraries like pandas, yfinance, and matplotlib.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe formula to calculate Maximum Drawdown is:\n\\[\nMDD = \\frac{P_{\\text{peak}} - P_{\\text{trough}}}{P_{\\text{peak}}} \\times 100\n\\]\nWhere:\n\nP_{peak} is the highest portfolio value during the analysis period.\nP_{trough} is the lowest portfolio value following that peak before a new peak is achieved.\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Assessment: Provides a clear numerical representation of potential losses during downturns.\nPortfolio Management: Helps in asset allocation and risk management.\nPerformance Comparison: Facilitates comparisons between different investments.\nEmotional Preparedness: Reduces panic selling by setting realistic expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Frame Dependency\nIgnores Recovery\nDoes Not Capture Volatility\nHistorical Data Reflection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen diving into the concept of maximum drawdown, it’s essential to start with the basics and ensure you’re on solid ground. First off, gathering and plotting financial data is the backbone of any credible analysis. By doing so, you avoid the classic pitfalls of using incorrect tickers or dodgy datasets, which can completely skew your findings. Trust me, there’s nothing worse than realising your conclusions are based on faulty data. Proper data handling also helps you spot trends and anomalies right from the start, making your analysis more robust. Plus, it builds a strong foundation for any advanced techniques you want to explore later on. So, take your time, get the basics right, and your insights will be all the more valuable and reliable for it.\n\n\nCode\n%%capture\nimport yfinance as yf\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Define the style\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\n\n# Download data\ndata = yf.download(['QQQ', 'SPY'], start='2018-01-01', end='2024-08-01')\n\n\n\n\nCode\nclosing_prices = data['Adj Close']\nclosing_prices = closing_prices / closing_prices.iloc[0]\n\n# Plotting the data\nclosing_prices.plot(title='AAPL and SPY Daily Closing Prices')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore diving into the chart, let’s break down the calculation of maximum drawdown. Maximum drawdown measures the largest single drop from peak to trough in the value of a financial asset before a new peak is achieved.\nAs mentioned above, to calculate it, we track the highest point of the asset’s value over a given period and compare it to the lowest point that follows. By doing this, we get a clear picture of the worst-case scenario in terms of losses. In the chart below, we’ve illustrated the maximum drawdown to visually capture these significant drops, providing a tangible sense of the risk involved.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate drawdowns\nclosing_prices = closing_prices / closing_prices.iloc[0]\ndrawdowns = -(closing_prices.cummax() - closing_prices)/closing_prices.cummax()\n\n# Plotting drawdown timeline\ndrawdowns.plot(title='Drawdown Timeline for AAPL and SPY')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestors and portfolio managers use Maximum Drawdown to assess risk, manage portfolios, and compare investment performance. While useful, it should be combined with other metrics for comprehensive risk management.\n\n\n\nFeel free to explore and test the code snippets provided.

Understanding MDD helps investors gauge the risk profile of their investments and make informed decisions.\n\n\n\nIn today’s volatile markets, comprehending the MDD of assets like QQQ (a NASDAQ ETF) and SPY (a S&P 500 ETF) can bring some help in grasping the risk of a particular asset. Such analysis provides a comparative view of the resilience of individual stocks versus market indices, aiding in better portfolio management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximum Drawdown is an important measure of investment risk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis blog aims to introduce Python enthusiasts and portfolio managers to the concept of Maximum Drawdown, demonstrating how to calculate and visualize it using Python libraries like pandas, yfinance, and matplotlib."

    "text": "When diving into the concept of maximum drawdown, it’s essential to start with the basics and ensure you’re on solid ground. First off, gathering and plotting financial data is the backbone of any credible analysis. By doing so, you avoid the classic pitfalls of using incorrect tickers or dodgy datasets, which can completely skew your findings. Trust me, there’s nothing worse than realising your conclusions are based on faulty data. Proper data handling also helps you spot trends and anomalies right from the start, making your analysis more robust. Plus, it builds a strong foundation for any advanced techniques you want to explore later on. So, take your time, get the basics right, and your insights will be all the more valuable and reliable for it.\n\n\nCode\n%%capture\nimport yfinance as yf\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Define the style\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\n\n# Download data\ndata = yf.download(['QQQ', 'SPY'], start='2018-01-01', end='2024-08-01')\n\n\n\n\nCode\nclosing_prices = data['Adj Close']\nclosing_prices = closing_prices / closing_prices.iloc[0]\n\n# Plotting the data\nclosing_prices.plot(title='AAPL and SPY Daily Closing Prices')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore diving into the chart, let’s break down the calculation of maximum drawdown. Maximum drawdown measures the largest single drop from peak to trough in the value of a financial asset before a new peak is achieved.\nAs mentioned above, to calculate it, we track the highest point of the asset’s value over a given period and compare it to the lowest point that follows. By doing this, we get a clear picture of the worst-case scenario in terms of losses. In the chart below, we’ve illustrated the maximum drawdown to visually capture these significant drops, providing a tangible sense of the risk involved.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate drawdowns\nclosing_prices = closing_prices / closing_prices.iloc[0]\ndrawdowns = -(closing_prices.cummax() - closing_prices)/closing_prices.cummax()\n\n# Plotting drawdown timeline\ndrawdowns.plot(title='Drawdown Timeline for AAPL and SPY')\nplt.show()"
