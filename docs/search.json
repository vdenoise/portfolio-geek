    "text": "Importance of Grasping Historical Volatility\n\nWhy Grasping Historical Volatility is Crucial\nIf you’re a budding financial engineer, investor, or market enthusiast, understanding historical volatility is crucial. Historical volatility, by referencing past price data, offers insights into the market’s perception of risk. Not only does it aid in evaluating the riskiness of an asset, but it also assists in crafting strategies to manage portfolios effectively.\n\n\nRelevance in Finance and Investing\n\nFinance and Investing: Historical volatility reflects the risk tied to an asset. A high volatility implies higher risk, which often translates to higher returns.\nPortfolio Management: Volatility helps in diversification by understanding how volatile an asset is compared to others in the portfolio.\nDerivatives Pricing: It is indispensable in options pricing. Models like Black-Scholes employ historical volatility to estimate an asset’s future risk.\n\n\n\nWhy We Need This Concept\n\nRisk Assessment: Enables us to quantify the risk and potential variation in returns for any given asset.\nInvestment Decisions: Guides investors on whether the asset’s risk matches their risk appetite.\nBenchmarking Performance: Facilitates comparisons with historical norms to identify unusual market behavior."

    "text": "Defining of Historical Volatility\n\nBreaking Down the Key Formula\nHistorical volatility measures how much the price of a stock varies over a period. The fundamental formula for historical volatility is:\n\\[\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (R_i - \\bar{R})^2}\n\\]\nWhere: - \\(\\sigma\\) is the historical volatility - \\(N\\) is the number of observations - \\(R_i\\) represents the logarithmic return of the price at time \\(i\\) - \\(\\bar{R}\\) is the average of the logarithmic returns\n\n\nAnnualizing Weekly Volatility\nTo annualize the volatility calculated from weekly data, we use:\n\\[\n\\sigma_{\\text{annual}} = \\sigma_{\\text{weekly}} \\times \\sqrt{52}\n\\]\nThis conversion is necessary as it scales the weekly volatility to an annual level, making comparisons with annualized returns straightforward.\n\n\nHow Parameters Affect the Results\n\nNumber of Observations (\\(N\\)): More observations typically lead to a more accurate estimation of volatility.\nLogarithmic Returns (\\(R_i\\)): Captures the continuous compounding of returns, reflecting the actual growth rate better than simple returns.\nAverage Logarithmic Return (\\(\\bar{R}\\)): Considering mean return centralizes the volatility measure, giving a base to calculate deviations."

This helps to evaluate the consistency and average performance of each fund on an annual basis.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate annualized returns\nannualized_returns = (((data.iloc[-1] / data.iloc[0]) ** (1 / 5)) - 1) * 100\n\n# Plot the annualized returns\nplt.style.use('ddm-chart.mplstyle')\nannualized_returns.plot(kind='bar')\nplt.title('Annualized Returns: QQQ vs. SPY (in %)')\nplt.xlabel('ETF')\nplt.ylabel('Annualized Return (in %)')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical Volatility of QQQ and SPY\nTo understand the risk associated with each ETF, we will plot their historical volatility. This is computed as the standard deviation of returns over the last five years, highlighting periods of higher volatility.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate historical volatility\nvolatility = data.pct_change().std() * (252 ** 0.5) * 100 # Annualized standard deviation\n\n# Plot historical volatility\nplt.style.use('ddm-chart.mplstyle')\nvolatility.plot(kind='bar')\nplt.title('Historical Volatility: QQQ vs. SPY  (in %)')\nplt.xlabel('ETF')\nplt.ylabel('Annualized Volatility (in %)')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating Excess Returns of QQQ and SPY\nTo move towards the Sharpe Ratio, let’s calculate the excess returns of QQQ and SPY by subtracting the risk-free rate (say, 4% per annum for example) from their respective returns. This sets the stage for understanding how much return is gained relative to a risk-free investment.\n\n\nCode\nrisk_free_rate = 0.04\n\n# Calculate excess returns\nexcess_returns = data.pct_change() - risk_free_rate / 252\n\n# Plot the excess returns\nplt.style.use('ddm-chart.mplstyle')\nexcess_returns.plot()\nplt.title('Excess Returns: QQQ vs. SPY')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Excess Return')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSharpe Ratios for QQQ and SPY\nNow, let’s calculate and display the Sharpe Ratios for QQQ and SPY. This provides a visual representation of their risk-adjusted performance, giving immediate insight into which asset class, fund or ETF has delivered better returns relative to the risks taken.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate Sharpe Ratios\nsharpe_ratio = excess_returns.mean() / excess_returns.std() * (252 ** 0.5)\n\n# Plot the Sharpe Ratios\nplt.style.use('ddm-chart.mplstyle')\nsharpe_ratio.plot(kind='bar')\nplt.title('Sharpe Ratio: QQQ vs. SPY')\nplt.xlabel('ETF')\nplt.ylabel('Sharpe Ratio')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRolling Sharpe Ratios for QQQ and SPY\nObserving the rolling Sharpe Ratios over a 12-month window provides enhanced insight into how risk-adjusted performance has changed over time under different market conditions.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate rolling Sharpe Ratios\nrolling_sharpe = (excess_returns.rolling(window=252).mean() / excess_returns.rolling(window=252).std()) * (252 ** 0.5)\n\n# Plot rolling Sharpe Ratios\nplt.style.use('ddm-chart.mplstyle')\nrolling_sharpe.plot()\nplt.title('Rolling 12-Month Sharpe Ratio: QQQ vs. SPY')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Rolling Sharpe Ratio')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing Cumulative Sharpe Ratios of QQQ and SPY\nLastly, let’s compare the cumulative Sharpe Ratios of QQQ and SPY against a designated benchmark (e.g., a broader market index). This helps to gauge how well each ETF has outperformed relative to overall market trends.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate cumulative Sharpe Ratios\ncumulative_sharpe = ((excess_returns.expanding(min_periods=252).mean()) / excess_returns.expanding().std()) * (252 ** 0.5)\n\n# Plot cumulative Sharpe Ratios\nplt.style.use('ddm-chart.mplstyle')\ncumulative_sharpe.plot()\nplt.title('Cumulative Sharpe Ratio: QQQ vs. SPY')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Cumulative Sharpe Ratio')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScatter Plot of Risk vs. Return\nFinally, we will create a scatter plot of risk versus return, plotting the expected returns of QQQ and SPY against their respective standard deviations. This visual representation underscores the efficient frontier concept, providing a comprehensive view of optimal risk-return trade-offs.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate expected returns and standard deviations\nexpected_returns = annualized_returns\nrisk = volatility\n\n# Scatter plot of risk vs. return\nplt.style.use('ddm-chart.mplstyle')\nplt.scatter(risk, expected_returns, label=['QQQ', 'SPY'])\nfor i, txt in enumerate(risk.index):\n    plt.annotate(txt, (risk[i], expected_returns[i]))\nplt.title('Risk vs. Return: QQQ vs. SPY')\nplt.xlabel('Annualized Volatility')\nplt.ylabel('Annualized Return')\nplt.show()"

    "text": "Estimate risk and return\nIn Markowitz 1952, the optimal portfolio is obtained as a function of expected returns and expected risks of the portfolio. This takes a strong assumption that we have a “crystal ball”, or at least access to a predictive model, which at this stage is well beyond this article.\nFor this first example, we will rely on historical parameters estimation, which precisely means that we expect the past to be a good prediction of what might happen in the future.\n\nVolatility\nThere are many ways to estimate the volatility, and I will only cover the simplest approach.\nWe have access to daily close prices of the ETFs, hence we could look at the standard deviation of daily returns. In theory this would utilise most of the data we have access to, which is a good thing. In practice, and especially when looking at asset classes which can be observed with an 8 to 12 hours time difference which might lead the “sample volatility” to become inconsistent between 2 asset classes. This is even more important for estimating the correlation.\nPractitioners often use weekly returns to alleviate this issue, and we will do the same here, and as such calculate the returns using a resampled time series. To calculate the annualized volatility requires an additional factor in this case the square root of 52. Why this?\nVolatility is essential to option traders, and when pricing options, practitioners often model asset prices as Wiener processes(number of weeks in a year) 3. The variance of a Wiener process is proportional to the time, and the volatility is the square root of the the variance, which gives us that to convert standard deviation of weekly returns into an annualized figure, we need to multiply our results by the square root of the number of weeks in a year.\n\n\nCode\nweekly_returns = df.resample(\"W\").last().pct_change()\n((weekly_returns.std()*math.sqrt(52)*100).sort_values()).plot.bar();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs one could have guessed, on the left of the chart above, we can find the low volatility asset classes (e.g. Government Bonds, Investment Grade Bonds), whereas on the right we have high volatility asset classes (Mid Cap and Small Cap Equities)."

Maximum drawdown measures the largest single drop from peak to trough in the value of a financial asset before a new peak is achieved.\nAs mentioned above, to calculate it, we track the highest point of the asset’s value over a given period and compare it to the lowest point that follows. By doing this, we get a clear picture of the worst-case scenario in terms of losses. In the chart below, we’ve illustrated the maximum drawdown to visually capture these significant drops, providing a tangible sense of the risk involved.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate drawdowns\nclosing_prices = closing_prices / closing_prices.iloc[0]\ndrawdowns = -(closing_prices.cummax() - closing_prices)/closing_prices.cummax()\n\n# Plotting drawdown timeline\ndrawdowns.plot(title='Drawdown Timeline for AAPL and SPY')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestors and portfolio managers use Maximum Drawdown to assess risk, manage portfolios, and compare investment performance. While useful, it should be combined with other metrics for comprehensive risk management.\n\n\n\nFeel free to explore and test the code snippets provided.

So, take your time, get the basics right, and your insights will be all the more valuable and reliable for it.\n\n\nCode\n%%capture\nimport yfinance as yf\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Define the style\nplt.style.use('ddm-chart.mplstyle')\n\n# Download data\ndata = yf.download(['QQQ', 'SPY'], start='2018-01-01', end='2024-08-01')\n\n\n\n\nCode\nclosing_prices = data['Adj Close']\nclosing_prices = closing_prices / closing_prices.iloc[0]\n\n# Plotting the data\nclosing_prices.plot(title='AAPL and SPY Daily Closing Prices')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore diving into the chart, let’s break down the calculation of maximum drawdown. Maximum drawdown measures the largest single drop from peak to trough in the value of a financial asset before a new peak is achieved.\nAs mentioned above, to calculate it, we track the highest point of the asset’s value over a given period and compare it to the lowest point that follows. By doing this, we get a clear picture of the worst-case scenario in terms of losses. In the chart below, we’ve illustrated the maximum drawdown to visually capture these significant drops, providing a tangible sense of the risk involved.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate drawdowns\nclosing_prices = closing_prices / closing_prices.iloc[0]\ndrawdowns = -(closing_prices.cummax() - closing_prices)/closing_prices.cummax()\n\n# Plotting drawdown timeline\ndrawdowns.plot(title='Drawdown Timeline for AAPL and SPY')\nplt.show()"
