Install VS Code via brew:\nVS Code is a robust and versatile code editor, while Miniconda, a mini version of Anaconda, allows us to create isolated Python environments and manage packages.\nUsing Brew, installed above, is a breeze\nbrew install --cask visual-studio-code\nAlternatively, you can download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website. Follow the prompts to complete the installation process.\n\n\n2.2 Miniconda\nUsing Brew\nbrew install --cask miniconda\nAlternatively, you can download and install Miniconda from the official website. During installation, ensure that you select the option to “Add Miniconda to my PATH environment variable”. This allows you to use conda commands directly in the VS Code terminal."

Installing Key Visual Studio Extensions\nThis step is not mandatory but it will be of tremendous help on a day to day basis. VS Code shines with its extensions. Here are a few that will make your life easier:\n\nPython: Gives you a host of Python-specific features like linting, debugging, code formatting, and more.\nPrettier: A code formatter that supports many languages, including Python. Keeps your code clean and professional.\nCode Spell Checker: Like a proof-reader, it catches common spelling mistakes in your code.\n\nYou can install these extensions by searching for them in the VS Code Extensions view (Ctrl + Shift + X) and clicking on “Install”."

As mentioned above, we will look at the performance of ETFs, which we will consider as as relevant proxies for their respective asset classes.\nYou can of course utilise whatever asset class you want, and take single stocks, funds as historical data points. On my side, I am quite familiar with indices ETFs, and I will go with the selection above.\nLast but not least, we need to define the start_date and end_date for gathering the historical time series.

    "text": "Estimate risk and return\nIn Markowitz 1952, the optimal portfolio is obtained as a function of expected returns and expected risks of the portfolio. This takes a strong assumption that we have a “crystal ball”, or at least access to a predictive model, which at this stage is well beyond this article.\nFor this first example, we will rely on historical parameters estimation, which precisely means that we expect the past to be a good prediction of what might happen in the future.\n\nVolatility\nThere are many ways to estimate the volatility, and I will only cover the simplest approach.\nWe have access to daily close prices of the ETFs, hence we could look at the standard deviation of daily returns. In theory this would utilise most of the data we have access to, which is a good thing. In practice, and especially when looking at asset classes which can be observed with an 8 to 12 hours time difference which might lead the “sample volatility” to become inconsistent between 2 asset classes. This is even more important for estimating the correlation.\nPractitioners often use weekly returns to alleviate this issue, and we will do the same here, and as such calculate the returns using a resampled time series. To calculate the annualized volatility requires an additional factor in this case the square root of 52. Why this?\nVolatility is essential to option traders, and when pricing options, practitioners often model asset prices as Wiener processes(number of weeks in a year) 3. The variance of a Wiener process is proportional to the time, and the volatility is the square root of the the variance, which gives us that to convert standard deviation of weekly returns into an annualized figure, we need to multiply our results by the square root of the number of weeks in a year.\n\n\nCode\nweekly_returns = df.resample(\"W\").last().pct_change()\n((weekly_returns.std()*math.sqrt(52)*100).sort_values()).plot.bar();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs one could have guessed, on the left of the chart above, we can find the low volatility asset classes (e.g. Government Bonds, Investment Grade Bonds), whereas on the right we have high volatility asset classes (Mid Cap and Small Cap Equities)."
