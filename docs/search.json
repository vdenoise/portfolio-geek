However, this correlation can change over time, leading to increased portfolio risk. Investors should regularly reassess their asset allocation.\n\n\nThe Impact of Amortizing Volatility across Private Investments\nAlpha Architect\nPrivate capital managers have discretion in valuing their portfolios, which results in smoother returns and understated volatility. Failure to consider lagged betas leads to underestimating risk and overestimating alpha. Mark Anson’s study found that private investments exhibit significant serial correlation at the quarterly level and that lagged betas account for a significant amount of returns associated with private capital alpha. Adjusting for lagged betas leads to lower allocations and drops in Sharpe ratios. It is important for investors to properly account for systemic risk in private assets by including estimates of lagged betas."

Terminal windows, bash script might look a bit obscure at first glance, but take it step by step and look at the video linked below to get more clarity on this. This is a marathon, definitely not a sprint.\n\n1.1 Install Homebrew\nHomebrew, affectionately known as brew, is the Swiss Army knife for installing software on macOS. It simplifies the process of managing software on your Mac, making it a breeze to install, uninstall, and update your applications.\nTo install Homebrew, open Terminal and enter:\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\n\n1.2 Install iTerm2\niTerm2 is an improvement over macOS’s default terminal, offering features such as split panes, search, and customisation. Install it via brew with:\nbrew install --cask iterm2\n\n\n1.3 Install Oh My Zsh:\nZsh, combined with Oh My Zsh, turns the dull default terminal into a powerful and enjoyable tool, complete with themes, plugins, and a vibrant community.\nInstall Oh My Zsh with:\nsh -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)\"\n::: {.content-visible unless-profile=“presentation”}"

    "text": "Estimate risk and return\nIn Markowitz 1952, the optimal portfolio is obtained as a function of expected returns and expected risks of the portfolio. This takes a strong assumption that we have a “crystal ball”, or at least access to a predictive model, which at this stage is well beyond this article.\nFor this first example, we will rely on historical parameters estimation, which precisely means that we expect the past to be a good prediction of what might happen in the future.\n\nVolatility\nThere are many ways to estimate the volatility, and I will only cover the simplest approach.\nWe have access to daily close prices of the ETFs, hence we could look at the standard deviation of daily returns. In theory this would utilise most of the data we have access to, which is a good thing. In practice, and especially when looking at asset classes which can be observed with an 8 to 12 hours time difference which might lead the “sample volatility” to become inconsistent between 2 asset classes. This is even more important for estimating the correlation.\nPractitioners often use weekly returns to alleviate this issue, and we will do the same here, and as such calculate the returns using a resampled time series. To calculate the annualized volatility requires an additional factor in this case the square root of 52. Why this?\nVolatility is essential to option traders, and when pricing options, practitioners often model asset prices as Wiener processes(number of weeks in a year) 3. The variance of a Wiener process is proportional to the time, and the volatility is the square root of the the variance, which gives us that to convert standard deviation of weekly returns into an annualized figure, we need to multiply our results by the square root of the number of weeks in a year.\n\n\nCode\nweekly_returns = df.resample(\"W\").last().pct_change()\n((weekly_returns.std()*math.sqrt(52)*100).sort_values()).plot.bar();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs one could have guessed, on the left of the chart above, we can find the low volatility asset classes (e.g. Government Bonds, Investment Grade Bonds), whereas on the right we have high volatility asset classes (Mid Cap and Small Cap Equities)."

Whilst this gap has been considerably reduced since then, thanks to internet and better information provided, many concepts still sound fairly exotic or technical to many investors.\nHere, I will try to demystify financial analysis and provide ideas and starting points in order to put theory into practice.\nIn most articles, you should be able to copy, run and modify the code behind the analysis. This should help you to directly use many of the tools presented. The entire source is available on Github"
