Failure to consider lagged betas leads to underestimating risk and overestimating alpha. Mark Anson’s study found that private investments exhibit significant serial correlation at the quarterly level and that lagged betas account for a significant amount of returns associated with private capital alpha. Adjusting for lagged betas leads to lower allocations and drops in Sharpe ratios. It is important for investors to properly account for systemic risk in private assets by including estimates of lagged betas.</td>

<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>Harry Markowitz</strong> is one of the (if not “the”) fathers of modern portfolio construction and his seminal paper Portfolio Selection <sup>1</sup> has driven an entire research stream.</p>
<p>The <strong>intuition</strong> behind this paper is that one can combine the information gathered on expected returns, risks and diversification of various assets or asset classes with a view to optimise the risk-return profile of a given portfolio.</p>
<p>In practice, we typically find a limited stability of the portfolios generated using this approach, especially due the high sensitivity of the portfolio to the expected returns; nonetheless, the insights it provides are very useful and it’s a perfect start to see the impact of risk and diversification.</p>
<p>For this article, we will mostly rely on a fantastic Python library, PyPortfolioOpt <sup>2</sup> which will do the optimisation heavy lifting for us.</p>
</section>
<section id="setup" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="setup">Setup</h2>
<section id="loading-libraries" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="loading-libraries">Loading Libraries</h3>
<p>The main library to load here is indeed <strong>PyPortfolioOpt</strong>, and we will rely extensively on it in this article.</p>
<p>We need the following tools as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pandas</strong>: load, filter, sort and pretty much all data wrangling operations;</li>
<li><strong>Numpy</strong>: provides most matrix and advanced numerical operations; this library is the calculation backbone for pandas;</li>
<li><strong>Matplotlib</strong>: the <em>de facto</em> reference library to draw scientific charts;</li>
<li><strong>yfinance</strong>: a very handy library to access many different online databases, including Yahoo Finance.</li>

<section id="defining-our-investable-universe" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="defining-our-investable-universe">Defining our Investable Universe</h2>
<p>First and foremost, we need to define our <strong>Investable Universe</strong> i.e.&nbsp;the set of asset classes that we will allow in our portfolio.</p>
<p>Many investors would typically think about single stocks, but on my side, I am typically looking at well diversified portfolios. Moreover, I am typically looking Long Term Investing, and as such, Indices, diversified portfolio or ETFs are in focus for me.</p>
<p>Speaking about asset classes, we need some ETFs to analyse!</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Important: Please bear in mind this article if purely for pedagogical purpose and should by no mean be understood as a recommendation or advice. Investing brings risk and in particular risk of loss of capital. I have no intention to recommend anything! I will follow among others this recent article in US News{% fn 7%} and ETF.com{% fn 8%} as sources of inspiration to identify relevant ETFs.”</p>
</blockquote>
<section id="equity" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="equity"><strong>Equity</strong></h4>
<p>Let’s start with various Equity sub-asset classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IVV</strong>: iShares Core <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong> ETF representing US Equity Large Cap</li>
<li><strong>SCHA</strong>: Schwab <strong>U.S. Small-Cap</strong> ETF representing US Equity Small Cap</li>
<li><strong>IJH</strong>: iShares Core <strong>S&amp;P Mid-Cap</strong> ETF representing US Equity Mid Cap</li>
<li><strong>SCHD</strong>: Schwab <strong>U.S. Dividend Equity</strong> ETF representing US Equity Dividend (ie US stocks which are deemed to pay higher dividends)</li>
<li><strong>VTI</strong>: Vanguard <strong>Total Stock Market</strong> ETF representing US Equity, with all market cap included</li>
<li><strong>VXUS</strong>: Vanguard <strong>Total International Stock</strong> ETF representing World ex-US equities</li>
<li><strong>EEM</strong>: iShares <strong>MSCI Emerging Markets</strong> ETF representing the Emerging Market Equities</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="fixed-income" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fixed-income"><strong>Fixed Income</strong></h4>
<p>Let’s add Fixed Income, which would typically aim to reduce the overall portfolio’s volatility:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AGG</strong>: iShares Core <strong>U.S. Aggregate Bond</strong> ETFrepresenting the entire US Bond market</li>
<li><strong>GOVT</strong>: iShares <strong>U.S. Treasury Bond</strong> ETF representing the performance of US Government Bonds</li>
<li><strong>VCLT</strong>: Vanguard <strong>Long-Term Corporate Bond</strong> ETF representing the Investment Grade USD denominated bonds.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="alternative-assets" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="alternative-assets"><strong>Alternative Assets</strong></h4>
<p>Let’s add 2 additional asset classes, Gold and Commodities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GLD</strong>: SPDR <strong>Gold</strong> Trust representing the price of **Gold</li>
<li><strong>PDBC</strong>: Invesco Optimum Yield Diversified <strong>Commodity</strong> Strategy No K-1 ETF** which will represent the performance of the Broad Commodities asset class</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything in the above is <strong>denominated in US Dollars</strong>, this will make our life easier in what follows, ie we will not need any currency conversion, which is always a bit painful in the process.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="parameters-and-data-gathering" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="parameters-and-data-gathering">Parameters and data gathering</h2>
<p>I recommend you to read this <strong><a href="../../posts/tutorials/en/spy-and-matplotlib.html">article about data gathering</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Like we did in this article, we will utilise <strong>yfinance</strong> to get historical time series. As mentioned above, we will look at the performance of ETFs, which we will consider as as relevant proxies for their respective asset classes.</p>
<p>You can of course utilise whatever asset class you want, and take single stocks, funds as historical data points. On my side, I am quite familiar with indices ETFs, and I will go with the selection above.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we need to define the <strong>start_date</strong> and <strong>end_date</strong> for gathering the historical time series. For this study, we will gather 7 years of data.</p>

<p>A very common issue when charting multiple time series is the very different stock levels, and this can make the chart hard to read.</p>

<section id="estimate-risk-and-return" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="estimate-risk-and-return">Estimate risk and return</h2>
<p>In <u>Markowitz 1952</u>, the optimal portfolio is obtained as a function of <em>expected</em> returns and <em>expected</em> risks of the portfolio. This takes a strong assumption that we have a “crystal ball”, or at least access to a predictive model, which at this stage is well beyond this article.</p>
<p>For this first example, we will rely on historical parameters estimation, which precisely means that we expect the past to be a good prediction of what might happen in the future.</p>
<section id="volatility" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="volatility">Volatility</h3>
<p>There are many ways to estimate the volatility, and I will only cover the simplest approach.</p>
<p>We have access to daily close prices of the ETFs, hence we could look at the standard deviation of <strong>daily</strong> returns. In theory this would utilise most of the data we have access to, which is a good thing. In practice, and especially when looking at asset classes which can be observed with an <strong>8 to 12 hours</strong> time difference which might lead the “sample volatility” to become inconsistent between 2 asset classes. This is even more important for estimating the <strong>correlation</strong>.</p>
<p>Practitioners often use <strong>weekly returns</strong> to alleviate this issue, and we will do the same here, and as such calculate the returns using a <em>resampled</em> time series. To calculate the <strong>annualized volatility</strong> requires an additional factor in this case the square root of 52. Why this?</p>
<p>Volatility is essential to option traders, and when pricing options, practitioners often model asset prices as <strong>Wiener processes</strong>(number of weeks in a year) <sup>3</sup>. The variance of a Wiener process is proportional to the time, and the volatility is the square root of the the variance, which gives us that to convert standard deviation of weekly returns into an <em>annualized</em> figure, we need to multiply our results by the square root of the number of weeks in a year.</p>

<p>As one could have guessed, on the left of the chart above, we can find the low volatility asset classes (e.g.&nbsp;Government Bonds, Investment Grade Bonds), whereas on the right we have high volatility asset classes (Mid Cap and Small Cap Equities).</p>

<p>With expected returns and risk estimated, we are ready to utilise PyPortfolioOpt’s optimiser to draw the <strong>efficient frontier</strong>.</p>
<p>The idea behind the efficient frontier is relatively simple: - For <strong>each level of investor’s risk</strong>, there is an optimal portfolio which is expected to deliver the <strong>highest level of return</strong>; or conversely - For <strong>each level of investor’s return</strong>, there is an optimal portfolio which is expected to deliver the <strong>lowest level of return</strong>.</p>

<p>Et voila!</p>
<p>Compared to macros or Excel formulas, this is an amazing improvement, and enables us to customise everything in seconds: historical timeframe, asset classes, etc.</p>
<p>To deliver a full portfolio optimisation process in such a limited number of lines is truly awesome.</p>
<p>I hope this article provided you some ideas on how to look at portfolio construction.</p>
<p>Happy coding, and happy portfolio construction!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the second episode of our Python and Quantitative Finance tutorial, where we will enter in our real Python journey.</p>
<p>In this first coding exercise, things will be very simple, we will essentially look at the past performance of a financial tool, an ETF. This ETF is called the SPY, it’s a US domiciled ETF that aims to replicate the performance of the S&amp;P 500 Index<sup>1</sup>, one of the key indices to measure the performance of the US Equity market.</p>

<section id="import-libraries" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="import-libraries">Import Libraries</h2>
<p>First, we import necessary libraries. yfinance will fetch the data, and matplotlib will help us chart it.</p>

<p>The function <code>tail</code> comes out of the <code>pandas</code> library, which is probably the most powerful library <sup>2</sup> I have seen in the last 2 decades!</p>
<p>Going through the details of this library is well beyond the scope of this article but will we will discover step by step of its most useful functions.</p>

<p>Let’s get ready, and gather some historical data for, say, 4 <strong>Exchange Traded Funds</strong> (ie “ETFs”, still commonly referred to as “trackers” in France): - SPY: <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong> - GLD: <strong>Gold</strong> - AGG: <strong>US Aggregate (US Bonds)</strong> - CAC.PA: <strong>CAC 40 (French Equity Index)</strong></p>
<p>You might wonder what the first 3 letters actually correspond to? They are the usual identifier for each ETF on the markets, and are often called the <strong>ticker</strong>of the ETF.</p>
<p>To gather data, you must <em>de facto</em> provide one ticker for each security, but if you forgot the ticker, Google is usually your friend!</p>
<p>We will need define to find a few more <strong>parameters</strong>: - The 2 variables start_date and end_date to keep some flexibility, - The variable <em>tickers</em> will store our ticker list, and pass it as a parameter to Yahoo, in order to specify our query.</p>

<p>The <strong>Adjusted Close</strong> field is returned by Yahoo Finance and is exactly what we are looking for.</p>
<p>Adjusted Close corresponds to the time series containing what we usually call the <em>total return</em>, typically <strong>compounding the dividends</strong> with the <strong>price returns</strong>.</p>
<p>This reflects the total return delivered by the ETF, should the investor reinvest systematically the dividend paid by the ETF by buying more this ETF. This is probably the most useful field when we aim to assess the <strong>long term returns of an asset class</strong>.</p>
<p>To quickly check the status of what we now have, note the use of the <strong>tail()</strong> function below, which get the last <em>n</em> rows of the dataset. Combined with Jupyter’s power in printing data, it’s probably the fastest way to navigate and check a particular dataset.</p>

<p>The chart above is useful, but the vast difference between the ETFs’ values makes it a bit hard to actually track each respective time series.</p>
<p>It would be more effective to <strong>normalise the data</strong>. It’s often referred to as “rebasing”, ie making each time series starting at 100, this will make it much easier to compare.</p>

<p>It’s often easy to get ‘seduced’ by the compelling long term returns, especially about Equities. And indeed, it was a good thing to be invested in Equities in the long run !</p>
<p>But 1y returns are usually a good way to keep track of the portfolio, and moreover to see how these returns have developed over time. With a 1y return chart, the notion of risk, ie either fast-changing returns, or - even worse - consistently negative returns, quickly becomes apparent.</p>

<p>The chart above is great, but a bit too busy for my taste. Whilst accurate, there is too much info going on, the noise might reduce our ability to spot real medium terms or breakouts.</p>
<p>This is where <strong>pandas</strong> starts to be really powerful. The <em>rolling()</em> function essentially captures sub-series, with a defined length (here 21 days). By <em>chaining</em> the results of rolling() with the <em>mean</em> function, ie calculating the arithmetic average, this will provide us in a one-liner with a new series. This generated dataframe contains the time series of the moving average (21 days) for each of our time series.</p>
<p>Whilst this “chaining” approach might initially sound obscure, this is <strong>extremely powerful</strong>, especially when factoring in the fact that you just need to change the tickers of the ETFs in the beginning of the article to entirely update the whole analysis … your turn!</p>

<p>So that’s it for this short intro on data gathering and visualising. In this article, we have gathered, checked, normalised and plot close prices for different ETFs.</p>
<p>The next step will be to use these function to generate some returns and risk statistics, and start exploring portfolio construction.</p>
<p>See you in the next article, and stay safe.</p>
