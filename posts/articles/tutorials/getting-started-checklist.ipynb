    "# Setting Up Your Financial Analysis Lab with Python and Visual Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "Greetings, Financial Wizards of the Future! Today, we're going to embark on an exciting expedition - setting up a cutting-edge financial analysis lab with Python and Visual Studio. We'll work on deploying various Python libraries, such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `yfinance`, and `pyportfolioopt` in our virtual environment. By the end of this guide, you'll be able to perform intricate financial analyses, portfolio backtesting, and more. Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up Visual Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "Our journey starts with installing Visual Studio Code, a versatile and user-friendly text editor. This is our base camp - the place from where all our future explorations commence. It's popular among developers due to its simplicity, efficiency, and range of extensions for different programming languages and tasks. Download the latest version from the [official Visual Studio website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the intuitive setup instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Anaconda, pip and Setting Up Conda Environment \n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda, an open-source distribution of Python and R, will be our next stop. It's especially popular among data scientists due to its vast library and package accessibility. You can download Anaconda from the [official Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Anaconda is installed, we'll utilise it to create a virtual environment - a self-contained setup where we can add the specific Python libraries we need for our work. To do this, open the Anaconda prompt and run the following command to create a new environment named 'finlab':\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create --name finlab python=3.8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating the environment, activate it with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate finlab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also utilise pip, a package manager for Python, to install some libraries. If it's not already installed, you can do so by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install pip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding Libraries to Our Python Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's move to adding some indispensable Python libraries to our environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pandas\n",
    "`Pandas` is a powerhouse in data manipulation and analysis. It provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures, making working with \"relational\" or \"labelled\" data both easy and intuitive. To install it, use the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pandas\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matplotlib and Seaborn\n",
    "`Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` are your go-to tools for data visualisation in Python. `Matplotlib` provides a robust foundation for creating static, animated, and interactive plots, while `Seaborn` is a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install matplotlib seaborn\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### yfinance\n",
    "`yfinance` offers a nifty way to download historical market data from Yahoo! finance. It's essential for sourcing real-world financial data for our backtesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install yfinance\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyPortfolioOpt\n",
    "Finally, we'll install `pyportfolioopt`, a library that provides advanced portfolio optimisation techniques. It enables efficient frontier calculation, risk analysis, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install PyPortfolioOpt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting with Visual Studio Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, with our environment fully set up, we can launch Visual Studio Code. Make sure to select the 'finlab' environment we created as your Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gathering Data and Plotting the Efficient Frontier\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by importing the necessary libraries and fetching the historical data for SPY (S&P 500 ETF), QQQ (NASDAQ 100 ETF), and AGG (US Aggregate Bond ETF) using `yfinance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import yfinance as\n",
    "\n",
    " yf\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "from pypfopt.efficient_frontier import EfficientFrontier\n",
    "from pypfopt import risk_models, expected_returns\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",
    "\n",
    "tickers = ['SPY', 'QQQ', 'AGG']\n",
    "data = yf.download(tickers, start=\"2016-01-01\", end=\"2023-06-25\")['Adj Close']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we calculate the expected returns and the annualised sample covariance matrix of the asset returns. We then use these to instantiate the `EfficientFrontier` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mu = expected_returns.mean_historical_return(data)\n",
    "S = risk_models.sample_cov(data)\n",
    "ef = EfficientFrontier(mu, S)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now plot the efficient frontier, which represents the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n",
    "ef.plot_efficient_frontier(ax)\n",
    "plt.title('Efficient Frontier')\n",
    "plt.xlabel('Volatility')\n",
    "plt.ylabel('Return')\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wrapping Up\n",
    "\n",
    "And voila! You've just set up your own financial analysis and portfolio backtesting lab. You've successfully taken the first step towards mastering the art of portfolio optimisation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, practice makes perfect. Use your new tools, experiment with different techniques, and explore the vast universe of financial data at your fingertips. The world of financial analysis awaits you!\n",
    "\n",
