| [Short Sellers Hate That These Stocks Are Moving Higher](https://moneymorning.com/2024/07/19/short-sellers-hate-that-these-stocks-are-moving-higher/) | Traders Reserve | Investors are moving away from large cap stocks as the Fed is likely to drop interest rates, causing a shift in sentiment. This is creating short squeeze opportunities in small cap stocks. Some short squeeze candidates include the S&P Biotech ETF(XBI), Chevron (CVX), and Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines (RCL).  |

| [Why is the stock-bond correlation important](http://mrzepczynski.blogspot.com/2024/07/why-is-stock-bond-correlation-important.html) | Disciplined Systematic Global Macro Views | The correlation between stocks and bonds is historically negative, providing diversification. However, this correlation can change over time, leading to increased portfolio risk. Investors should regularly reassess their asset allocation.  | 
| [The Impact of Amortizing Volatility across Private Investments](https://alphaarchitect.com/2024/07/amortizing-volatility/) | Alpha Architect | Private capital managers have discretion in valuing their portfolios, which results in smoother returns and understated volatility. Failure to consider lagged betas leads to underestimating risk and overestimating alpha. Mark Anson's study found that private investments exhibit significant serial correlation at the quarterly level and that lagged betas account for a significant amount of returns associated with private capital alpha. Adjusting for lagged betas leads to lower allocations and drops in Sharpe ratios. It is important for investors to properly account for systemic risk in private assets by including estimates of lagged betas.  |
