| [Private Investments: Unveiling Hidden Risks and Smoothing Effects on Volatility (Alpha Architect, 2024-07-19)](https://alphaarchitect.com/2024/07/amortizing-volatility/)   | Private capital managers have discretion in valuing their portfolios, which results in smoother returns and understated volatility. Failure to consider lagged betas leads to underestimating risk and overestimating alpha. Mark Anson's study found that private investments exhibit significant serial correlation at the quarterly level and that lagged betas account for a significant amount of returns associated with private capital alpha. Adjusting for lagged betas leads to lower allocations and drops in Sharpe ratios. It is important for investors to properly account for systemic risk in private assets by including estimates of lagged betas. |
