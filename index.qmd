## Welcome to Portfolio Geek

With 20+ years of experience in **portfolio construction, asset allocation and quantitative research**, I have worked across the entire **asset management** and **financial markets** value chain.  

In this blog, I document my findings and experiments, notably in **Python**, **Jupyter** and along themes like **portfolio optimisation** and **reproducible research**.

In particular, [this section](/tutorials_en.html) provides you with a **Zero to Hero** experience in Python and Quantitative Finance.
