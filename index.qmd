## Welcome to Portfolio Geek

With 20+ years of experience in **portfolio construction, asset allocation and quantitative research**, I have worked across the entire **asset management** and **financial markets** value chain.  

In this blog, I document my findings and experiments, notably in **Python**, **Jupyter** and along themes like **portfolio optimisation** and **reproducible research**.
