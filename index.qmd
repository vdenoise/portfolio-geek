## Welcome to Portfolio Geek

With 20 years of experience in **portfolio construction, asset allocation and quantitative research**, I have worked across the entire **asset management** and **financial markets** industry's value chain.  

In this blog, I will document here my findings and experiments, notably in **Python**, **Jupyter** and along themes like **portfolio optimisation** and **reproducible research**.

In particular, [this section](/tutorials_en.html) provides you with a "Zero to Hero" experience in Python and Quantitative Finance.

In my different roles, I have developed and deployed a wide range range of investment solutions, ranging from **Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)**, **derivatives** and **investment mandates** across most asset classes: Equities, Fixed Income, Commodities, Alternative Assets, Multi-Asset portfolios.
