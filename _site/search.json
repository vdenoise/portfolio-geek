Adjusting for lagged betas leads to lower allocations and drops in Sharpe ratios. It is important for investors to properly account for systemic risk in private assets by including estimates of lagged betas."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the world of finance and investing, understanding how closely an investment tracks its benchmark index is crucial for evaluating performance and risk. This concept is known as tracking error. In this blog post, we’ll delve into the tracking error of QQQ and SPY using weekly returns. We’ll discuss why this metric matters, how it’s calculated, and provide you with a full suite of examples using Python to analyze these ETFs.\n\n\nTracking error is a measure of how closely a fund follows its benchmark index. For investors and portfolio managers, this metric is crucial as it helps in assessing the risk associated with a fund’s performance relative to its benchmark. If you’re using index funds or ETFs like QQQ and SPY, tracking error gives you insights into how accurately these funds replicate their respective indices. For this article we will use the same metric to compare 2 ETFs, with a ### Performance Evaluation\nTracking error provides a clear picture of how well a fund replicates its benchmark. If the tracking error is low, the fund closely follows the index, making it a reliable choice for passive investors. ### Risk Assessment\nIt helps investors understand the consistency of a fund’s returns relative to its benchmark. A high tracking error indicates higher risk and volatility, signaling investors to tread with caution. ### Portfolio Management\nFund managers use tracking error to make informed decisions about rebalancing their portfolios. By minimizing tracking error, they can align their funds more closely with the benchmark, offering stable returns.\n\n\n\nTracking error is essentially the standard deviation of the difference between the portfolio returns and the benchmark returns over a specified period. The formula for tracking error is:\n\\[\n\\text{Tracking Error} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (R_{p,i} - R_{b,i})^2 }\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n(R_{p,i}) = Return of the portfolio (e.g., QQQ) for period (i)\n(R_{b,i}) = Return of the benchmark index (e.g., SPY) for period (i)\n(N) = Total number of periods (weekly returns in our case)\n\nThis formula calculates the standard deviation of the difference between portfolio returns and benchmark returns. A lower tracking error indicates closer alignment, whereas a higher tracking error indicates greater deviation.\n\n\n\nTo get started, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:\npip install yfinance pandas numpy matplotlib\n\n\nWe’ll use the yfinance library to download the historical weekly data for QQQ and SPY.\n\n\nCode\n%%capture\nimport yfinance as yf\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Download historical data for QQQ and SPY\nqqq = yf.download('QQQ', start='2015-01-01', end='2024-06-30', interval='1wk')\nspy = yf.download('SPY', start='2015-01-01', end='2024-06-30', interval='1wk')\n\n# Calculate weekly returns\nqqq['Weekly Return'] = qqq['Adj Close'].pct_change().dropna()\nspy['Weekly Return'] = spy['Adj Close'].pct_change().dropna()\n\n\n\n\n\nWith our weekly returns calculated, we can now compute the tracking error.\n\n\nCode\n# Align the indexes of QQQ and SPY weekly returns\nplt.style.use('ddm-chart.mplstyle')\ncombined = pd.concat([qqq['Weekly Return'], spy['Weekly Return']], axis=1, join='inner')\ncombined.columns = ['QQQ Return', 'SPY Return']\n\n# Calculate tracking error\ncombined['Tracking Error'] = combined['QQQ Return'] - combined['SPY Return']\ntracking_error = np.std(combined['Tracking Error']) * np.sqrt(52)  # Annualize the tracking error\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisuals often provide the best insight into data trends and relationships. Let’s create various charts to help us understand the performance, volatility, and tracking error of QQQ and SPY.\n\n\nA line chart showcasing the historical weekly closing prices of QQQ and SPY over the past five years provides a visual representation of performance trends. This chart allows investors to quickly identify trends, correlations, and divergence periods between the two funds.\n\n\nCode\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Plot weekly closing prices\nax.plot(qqq['Adj Close'], label='QQQ')\nax.plot(spy['Adj Close'], label='SPY')\nax.set_title('Weekly Closing Prices (QQQ vs. SPY)')\nax.set_xlabel('Date')\nax.set_ylabel('Price ($)')\nax.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA bar chart displaying the weekly returns of QQQ and SPY side-by-side for the same five-year period illustrates the short-term performance comparison. This view makes it easier to observe how often QQQ’s returns outperformed or underperformed SPY during the specified timeframe.\n\n\nCode\nimport matplotlib.dates as mdates\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\n\n# Plot weekly returns\ncombined[['QQQ Return', 'SPY Return']].tail(104).multiply(100).plot(kind='bar', ax=ax, width=0.8)\nax.set_title('Weekly Returns (QQQ vs. SPY, in %)')\nax.set_xlabel('Date')\nax.xaxis.set_major_locator(mdates.MonthLocator(interval=1)) \n\nax.set_ylabel('Weekly Return')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA scatter plot of weekly returns for QQQ against SPY helps depict the relationship between the returns of these two ETFs. By analyzing the data points’ distribution, investors can assess the levels of correlation and volatility between the two funds.\n\n\nCode\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\n\n# Scatter plot of weekly returns\nax.scatter(combined['QQQ Return'], combined['SPY Return'])\nax.set_title('Scatter Plot of Weekly Returns (QQQ vs. SPY)')\nax.set_xlabel('QQQ Weekly Return')\nax.set_ylabel('SPY Weekly Return')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA histogram of the weekly returns for QQQ and SPY provides insights into the distribution of returns over the displayed five-year period. This visualization helps highlight the frequency of different return sizes and indicates whether one ETF exhibited more consistent performance.\n\n\nCode\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\n\n# Histogram of weekly returns\ncombined['QQQ Return'].hist(ax=ax, alpha=0.5, bins=50, label='QQQ')\ncombined['SPY Return'].hist(ax=ax, alpha=0.5, bins=50, label='SPY')\nax.set_title('Histogram of Weekly Returns (QQQ vs. SPY)')\nax.set_xlabel('Weekly Return')\nax.set_ylabel('Frequency')\nax.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA chart showing the rolling standard deviation of weekly returns for QQQ and SPY illustrates the volatility of each ETF over time.

    "text": "Analising QQQ vs. SPY through a Sharpe Ratio lens\n\nHistorical Price Data of QQQ and SPY\nUnderstanding how QQQ (NASDAQ-100) and SPY (S&P 500) performed over the last five years is always a good starting point. This visualization shows their performance trends and helps to lay the groundwork for further analysis.\n\n\nCode\n%%capture\nimport yfinance as yf\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Fetch historical price data for QQQ and SPY\ntickers = [\"QQQ\", \"SPY\"]\ndata = yf.download(tickers, start=\"2018-01-01\", end=\"2023-12-31\")['Adj Close']\n\n# Plot the data\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\ndata.plot()\nplt.title('Historical Price Data: QQQ vs. SPY')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Adjusted Close Price')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnualized Returns of QQQ and SPY\nNow, let’s compare the annualized returns of QQQ and SPY over the same time period. This helps to evaluate the consistency and average performance of each fund on an annual basis.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate annualized returns\nannualized_returns = (((data.iloc[-1] / data.iloc[0]) ** (1 / 5)) - 1) * 100\n\n# Plot the annualized returns\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\nannualized_returns.plot(kind='bar')\nplt.title('Annualized Returns: QQQ vs. SPY (in %)')\nplt.xlabel('ETF')\nplt.ylabel('Annualized Return (in %)')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical Volatility of QQQ and SPY\nTo understand the risk associated with each ETF, we will plot their historical volatility. This is computed as the standard deviation of returns over the last five years, highlighting periods of higher volatility.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate historical volatility\nvolatility = data.pct_change().std() * (252 ** 0.5) * 100 # Annualized standard deviation\n\n# Plot historical volatility\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\nvolatility.plot(kind='bar')\nplt.title('Historical Volatility: QQQ vs. SPY  (in %)')\nplt.xlabel('ETF')\nplt.ylabel('Annualized Volatility (in %)')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating Excess Returns of QQQ and SPY\nTo move towards the Sharpe Ratio, let’s calculate the excess returns of QQQ and SPY by subtracting the risk-free rate (say, 4% per annum for example) from their respective returns. This sets the stage for understanding how much return is gained relative to a risk-free investment.\n\n\nCode\nrisk_free_rate = 0.04\n\n# Calculate excess returns\nexcess_returns = data.pct_change() - risk_free_rate / 252\n\n# Plot the excess returns\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\nexcess_returns.plot()\nplt.title('Excess Returns: QQQ vs. SPY')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Excess Return')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSharpe Ratios for QQQ and SPY\nNow, let’s calculate and display the Sharpe Ratios for QQQ and SPY. This provides a visual representation of their risk-adjusted performance, giving immediate insight into which asset class, fund or ETF has delivered better returns relative to the risks taken.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate Sharpe Ratios\nsharpe_ratio = excess_returns.mean() / excess_returns.std() * (252 ** 0.5)\n\n# Plot the Sharpe Ratios\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\nsharpe_ratio.plot(kind='bar')\nplt.title('Sharpe Ratio: QQQ vs. SPY')\nplt.xlabel('ETF')\nplt.ylabel('Sharpe Ratio')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRolling Sharpe Ratios for QQQ and SPY\nObserving the rolling Sharpe Ratios over a 12-month window provides enhanced insight into how risk-adjusted performance has changed over time under different market conditions.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate rolling Sharpe Ratios\nrolling_sharpe = (excess_returns.rolling(window=252).mean() / excess_returns.rolling(window=252).std()) * (252 ** 0.5)\n\n# Plot rolling Sharpe Ratios\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\nrolling_sharpe.plot()\nplt.title('Rolling 12-Month Sharpe Ratio: QQQ vs. SPY')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Rolling Sharpe Ratio')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing Cumulative Sharpe Ratios of QQQ and SPY\nLastly, let’s compare the cumulative Sharpe Ratios of QQQ and SPY against a designated benchmark (e.g., a broader market index). This helps to gauge how well each ETF has outperformed relative to overall market trends.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate cumulative Sharpe Ratios\ncumulative_sharpe = ((excess_returns.expanding(min_periods=252).mean()) / excess_returns.expanding().std()) * (252 ** 0.5)\n\n# Plot cumulative Sharpe Ratios\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\ncumulative_sharpe.plot()\nplt.title('Cumulative Sharpe Ratio: QQQ vs. SPY')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Cumulative Sharpe Ratio')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScatter Plot of Risk vs. Return\nFinally, we will create a scatter plot of risk versus return, plotting the expected returns of QQQ and SPY against their respective standard deviations. This visual representation underscores the efficient frontier concept, providing a comprehensive view of optimal risk-return trade-offs.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate expected returns and standard deviations\nexpected_returns = annualized_returns\nrisk = volatility\n\n# Scatter plot of risk vs. return\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\nplt.scatter(risk, expected_returns, label=['QQQ', 'SPY'])\nfor i, txt in enumerate(risk.index):\n    plt.annotate(txt, (risk[i], expected_returns[i]))\nplt.title('Risk vs. Return: QQQ vs. SPY')\nplt.xlabel('Annualized Volatility')\nplt.ylabel('Annualized Return')\nplt.show()"

    "title": "10 Quotes to Understand the Concept of Volatility",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Volatility is a term that carries both risk and opportunity. In financial markets, it can represent the fear of loss as well as the potential for gains. In life, it symbolizes the unpredictability that makes each day a challenge and an adventure. This article explores volatility through the words of some of the most insightful thinkers in history. These quotes and their explanations provide a deeper understanding of how volatility shapes our decisions, our strategies, and our futures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“In investing, what is comfortable is rarely profitable.” – Robert Arnott\n\nThis quote by Robert Arnott touches on the uncomfortable truth that volatility often brings discomfort, yet it is precisely in these moments of uncertainty where significant profits can be made. Many investors shy away from volatile markets, fearing the risk of loss. However, those who understand that volatility also means opportunity can position themselves to take advantage of price fluctuations. This concept is backed by the “risk-reward tradeoff” in finance, which suggests that higher risks can lead to higher rewards. The key is not to avoid volatility, but to manage it effectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The stock market is filled with individuals who know the price of everything, but the value of nothing.” – Philip Fisher\n\nPhilip Fisher highlights the distinction between price and value in a volatile market. Volatility can cause wild swings in stock prices, but these fluctuations do not necessarily reflect the underlying value of the companies. This is where many investors falter, focusing on the price movement rather than the intrinsic value. In a volatile market, successful investors are those who can look beyond the noise and identify opportunities where the market has mispriced a stock. Warren Buffett, a disciple of Fisher, famously applied this principle throughout his investing career.\n\n“The four most dangerous words in investing are: ‘This time it’s different.’” – Sir John Templeton\n\nSir John Templeton’s quote serves as a warning against the temptation to believe that the current market volatility is unprecedented or will lead to a fundamentally different outcome. History has shown that market patterns often repeat themselves, and believing that “this time it’s different” can lead to disastrous decisions. During times of volatility, it’s essential to remain grounded in fundamental analysis and historical precedent, rather than being swayed by emotions or the belief that the old rules no longer apply. Templeton’s success as an investor was built on the principle of buying when others are fearful.\n\n“Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.” – Charlie Munger\n\nCharlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s longtime business partner, sheds light on the distinction between volatility and risk. Many investors mistakenly equate the two, fearing volatility as if it were synonymous with loss. However, Munger argues that the real risk is not the temporary ups and downs, but rather the permanent loss of capital. In essence, volatility should not be feared if you have a solid understanding of the value of your investments and a long-term perspective. Munger and Buffett’s investment philosophy is rooted in the idea of enduring short-term volatility for the sake of long-term gain.\n\n“The key to making money in stocks is not to get scared out of them.” – Peter Lynch\n\nPeter Lynch emphasizes the importance of staying the course during periods of volatility. Many investors panic when the market becomes turbulent, selling off their holdings out of fear. However, Lynch argues that successful investing requires the courage to withstand these fluctuations without being scared out of the market. His famous book, “One Up on Wall Street,” stresses the value of long-term thinking and patience, noting that volatility is a natural part of the market cycle and should not be a reason to abandon a well-considered investment strategy.\n\n“You get recessions, you have stock market declines. If you don’t understand that’s going to happen, then you’re not ready, you won’t do well in the markets.” – Peter Lynch\n\nPaul Samuelson, the first American to win the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, explains the inevitability of recessions and market downturns. His message is clear: volatility is an inherent aspect of the economic and market cycles. Investors who recognize this and prepare accordingly are better equipped to navigate these periods without making rash decisions. The ability to weather volatility and remain focused on long-term goals is what separates successful investors from the rest. Samuelson’s insight reflects the importance of education and preparedness in the face of inevitable economic fluctuations.\n\n“The greatest danger in times of turbulence is not the turbulence; it is to act with yesterday’s logic.” – Peter Drucker\n\nPeter Drucker, the father of modern management, points out that volatility demands a shift in thinking. When markets or situations become turbulent, relying on outdated strategies or mindsets can lead to failure. Instead, adaptability and forward-thinking are crucial in navigating through volatility. Drucker’s approach underscores the importance of innovation and the willingness to reassess and adjust strategies in response to changing conditions. In the business world, as in investing, those who can evolve with the times are better positioned to succeed, even in the face of volatility.\n\n“Do not anticipate trouble, or worry about what may never happen. Keep in the sunlight.” – Benjamin Franklin\n\nBenjamin Franklin’s wisdom reminds us of the dangers of excessive worry, especially in times of volatility. While it is natural to be concerned about potential downturns or losses, fixating on what might go wrong can lead to paralysis or poor decision-making. Franklin’s advice is to focus on the present and take things one step at a time. In the context of investing, this means not overreacting to market volatility or letting fear dictate your actions. Instead, maintaining a balanced perspective and sticking to a well-thought-out plan is more likely to yield positive results in the long run.\n\n“The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.” – Benjamin Graham\n\nBenjamin Graham, known as the father of value investing, encapsulates the strategy of taking advantage of volatility by being level-headed when others are driven by emotion. Volatility often leads to overreactions in the market—optimists driving prices too high and pessimists driving them too low. The intelligent investor recognizes these patterns and capitalizes on them, buying when prices are low due to fear and selling when prices are high due to excessive optimism. This disciplined approach is the cornerstone of value investing and has been successfully employed by many, including Warren Buffett.\n\n“In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity.” – Sun Tzu\n\nSun Tzu, the ancient Chinese military strategist, provides timeless wisdom that is equally applicable to modern financial markets. Volatility, much like chaos in battle, can be disorienting and frightening. However, it also presents unique opportunities for those who are prepared to seize them. This perspective encourages a proactive rather than a reactive approach to volatility. By maintaining discipline and seeking out opportunities amid market turbulence, investors can turn potential losses into gains. Sun Tzu’s principle reminds us that with the right mindset, even the most chaotic situations can be turned to our advantage.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, volatility is an inevitable part of both life and the markets. It can evoke fear and uncertainty, but it also offers the chance for growth and opportunity. The quotes and explanations provided in this article emphasize the importance of understanding volatility and not shying away from it. By embracing volatility and learning to navigate its challenges, we can better position ourselves for success, whether in investing, business, or personal growth. As history has shown, those who can adapt and remain focused amid uncertainty are often the ones who emerge stronger and more successful."

    "title": "10 Quotes to Grasp the Markowitz’s legacy in Portfolio Construction",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In the ever-evolving world of finance, few figures have had as profound an impact as Harry Markowitz. His groundbreaking work on Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) laid the foundation for the way we think about risk, return, and diversification in investment portfolios. The legacy of Markowitz’s ideas continues to influence how portfolios are constructed, managed, and optimized. In this article, we will explore ten powerful and insightful quotes from renowned financial experts that highlight the enduring significance of Markowitz’s contributions to the portfolio construction ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The primary challenge of investment management is to decide on the best allocation of wealth among different assets.” – Harry Markowitz\n\nHarry Markowitz’s observation captures the essence of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), which fundamentally changed how we approach asset allocation. The key challenge in investment management is balancing the trade-off between risk and return. Markowitz demonstrated mathematically that by diversifying across a mix of assets, investors could minimize risk for a given level of expected return. This concept is graphically represented by the Efficient Frontier, a curve that shows the optimal portfolios offering the maximum possible return for a given level of risk. The introduction of these ideas has had a lasting impact, guiding both individual and institutional investors in their portfolio construction decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Diversification is the only free lunch in finance.” – Harry Markowitz\n\nThis famous quote from Markowitz encapsulates the significant benefit of diversification—a strategy that allows investors to reduce the overall risk of their portfolio without sacrificing expected returns. By spreading investments across various assets, ideally those with low or negative correlations, an investor can smooth out the volatility and enhance the risk-adjusted returns of their portfolio. This principle is a cornerstone of Modern Portfolio Theory, and it has been embraced globally by investors who seek to manage risk more effectively. The “free lunch” in this context is the risk reduction that diversification provides, which comes at no additional cost.\n\n“The risk of a portfolio is not the sum of the risks of its assets.” – William Sharpe\n\nWilliam Sharpe, a key figure in the development of financial theory, highlights a fundamental aspect of Modern Portfolio Theory. The risk of a portfolio is not merely the sum of the risks of its individual assets; rather, it is determined by how those assets interact, particularly in terms of their correlations. If assets are uncorrelated or negatively correlated, combining them can reduce the overall portfolio risk more than if they were considered individually. This concept is crucial for understanding how to build diversified portfolios that optimize risk and return, a principle that remains central to portfolio management.\n\n“Modern Portfolio Theory is a systematic framework for managing risk and return in investment portfolios.” – Michael Jensen\n\nMichael Jensen succinctly captures the essence of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) as a structured approach to balancing risk and return. MPT provides investors with a framework to make informed decisions by optimally diversifying their investments across various asset classes. The theory emphasises that through diversification, the unsystematic risk of a portfolio can be minimized, leaving investors to deal primarily with systematic risk, which is inherent to the market. This systematic approach laid the groundwork for subsequent developments in portfolio management and remains a fundamental component of financial theory.\n\n“The efficient frontier is a set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk.” – James Tobin\n\nJames Tobin’s description of the Efficient Frontier encapsulates a key concept in Modern Portfolio Theory. The Efficient Frontier represents the best possible combinations of assets that provide the maximum expected return for a given level of risk. This concept allows investors to make informed decisions about where to position their portfolios on this frontier based on their risk tolerance. Tobin’s work also introduced the idea of combining risky assets with a risk-free asset, which allows for the creation of a Capital Market Line—a key development that further expanded the applicability of MPT in practical investing.\n\n“The Markowitz model has provided a foundation for the way we think about risk in investment.” – Robert Merton\n\nRobert Merton, a Nobel laureate in economics, acknowledges the profound impact of Markowitz’s model on modern investment practices. The Markowitz model introduced a new way of thinking about risk, shifting the focus from individual asset risks to the risk of the overall portfolio. This paradigm shift encouraged investors to consider the correlations between assets, leading to more sophisticated risk management strategies. Merton’s recognition of Markowitz’s contribution highlights how these ideas have permeated financial theory, forming the bedrock of modern portfolio construction and risk management.\n\n“Diversification is both observed and sensible; a rule of behavior which does not imply the superiority of diversification must be rejected both as a hypothesis and as a maxim.” – Paul Samuelson\n\nPaul Samuelson, another Nobel Prize-winning economist, eloquently emphasises the rationality behind diversification. His assertion suggests that diversification is not just a theoretical concept but one that is consistently observed in practice. Samuelson argues that any investment strategy that disregards the benefits of diversification is fundamentally flawed. This reinforces the importance of diversification in managing risk and optimizing returns—a principle that underpins Modern Portfolio Theory. Samuelson’s statement further solidifies the idea that diversification is essential for prudent investing.\n\n“The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak.” – Hans Hofmann\n\nWhile Hans Hofmann was an artist, his wisdom applies remarkably well to portfolio management. Simplifying an investment portfolio by eliminating unnecessary complexity can often lead to better performance. In the context of Modern Portfolio Theory, this means focusing on diversification and proper asset allocation rather than chasing complex strategies or high-risk investments. By concentrating on what is necessary—balancing risk and return—investors can construct portfolios that are not only easier to manage but also more likely to achieve their financial goals. Hofmann’s advice is a reminder that simplicity often leads to clarity and success.\n\n“Risk comes from not knowing what you’re doing.” – Warren Buffett\n\nWarren Buffett, one of the most successful investors of all time, reminds us that risk is often the result of ignorance or a lack of understanding. In the context of portfolio management, this reinforces the importance of knowledge and informed decision-making. Modern Portfolio Theory equips investors with the tools and frameworks needed to understand and manage risk effectively. By diversifying and carefully selecting assets, investors can mitigate the unknowns that contribute to risk. Buffett’s advice serves as a powerful reminder that understanding the principles of risk management is crucial to successful investing.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, Harry Markowitz’s legacy in the portfolio construction ecosystem is immense and enduring.

From the foundational concept of the Efficient Frontier to the practical implementation of diversification, Markowitz’s work has shaped how investors think about and approach portfolio management.

    "text": "Welcome to our exploration of small cap investing. In the world of finance, small cap stocks often spark intense debates among investors. These companies, generally characterised by their relatively modest market capitalisations, offer both significant opportunities and notable risks. As we delve into the insights from various experts on small cap investing, you’ll discover a range of perspectives that highlight the potential for high rewards, as well as the inherent volatility associated with these stocks. Our curated quotes will guide you through the complex landscape of small cap investing, providing valuable wisdom from some of the foremost thinkers in finance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall-cap stocks are inherently riskier but provide potentially higher rewards compared to their large-cap counterparts. – Peter Lynch\n\nPeter Lynch, a renowned investor and author of “One Up On Wall Street,” emphasises the risk-reward dynamic of small cap stocks. These companies often have higher growth potential due to their smaller size and emerging market positions. However, this potential comes with increased volatility and risks, making thorough research essential. Investors need to balance their risk tolerance with the potential for substantial returns. Studies suggest that small-cap stocks can outperform large-cap stocks over long periods, but their prices can be more susceptible to market swings. For instance, according to historical data, small-cap stocks have delivered higher returns over extended periods compared to large-cap stocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in small-cap stocks requires patience and a long-term perspective. – Warren Buffett\n\nWarren Buffett, one of the most successful investors of all time, highlights the importance of patience in small cap investing. Small cap stocks often take time to realise their potential, and their value can fluctuate significantly in the short term. A long-term approach allows investors to weather market volatility and benefit from the growth of these smaller companies. Buffett’s investment strategy typically focuses on companies with strong fundamentals and the potential for future growth, a principle that applies to small cap stocks as well. Historical data shows that holding small-cap stocks over extended periods can yield substantial returns, provided that investors remain patient and disciplined.\n\nSmall caps can offer explosive growth, but with that comes greater volatility. – John Bogle\n\nJohn Bogle, the founder of Vanguard Group, is known for his emphasis on low-cost investing and index funds. He points out that while small cap stocks can provide remarkable growth opportunities, they also come with greater price fluctuations. This increased volatility can be daunting for some investors, but it also presents the chance for higher returns if managed correctly. Bogle’s advice often centres on diversifying investments and staying the course, which is crucial when dealing with the unpredictable nature of small cap stocks. Investors should consider balancing their small cap investments with more stable assets to manage overall risk effectively.\n\nIn small-cap investing, thorough research is your best ally. – Benjamin Graham\n\nBenjamin Graham, the father of value investing, underscores the importance of thorough research when investing in small-cap stocks. These companies often lack the extensive financial histories and market stability of larger firms, making due diligence essential. Investors need to delve into financial statements, business models, and market conditions to make informed decisions. Graham’s value investing principles suggest focusing on intrinsic value and margin of safety, which can help mitigate some of the risks associated with small-cap investments. Effective research can reveal undervalued stocks with strong growth potential, offering opportunities for substantial gains.\n\nSmall caps can be an excellent way to diversify a portfolio, but they require careful selection. – Howard Marks\n\nHoward Marks, co-founder of Oaktree Capital Management, highlights the role of small-cap stocks in portfolio diversification. These stocks can offer unique growth opportunities that are not available with larger companies, adding a layer of diversification to an investment portfolio. However, careful selection is crucial as small-cap stocks can vary significantly in quality and risk. Marks suggests focusing on companies with strong fundamentals and growth potential while being mindful of the inherent risks. Diversification with small caps can enhance returns, but it requires a strategic approach to manage the associated risks effectively.\n\nThe potential for high returns from small-cap stocks is often accompanied by higher risk. – Jim Cramer\n\nJim Cramer, the host of CNBC’s “Mad Money,” acknowledges the high return potential of small-cap stocks but also warns of the associated risks. Small-cap stocks are often more volatile and can be subject to rapid price changes due to\ntheir smaller market size and lower liquidity. Cramer advises investors to be prepared for substantial fluctuations and to have a well-thought-out strategy when investing in these stocks. The high risk is balanced by the potential for high rewards, and successful small-cap investing often requires active management and a good understanding of market dynamics.\n\nSmall caps are the future giants, and investing in them early can lead to substantial gains. – Mark Cuban\n\nMark Cuban, the entrepreneur and investor, points out that many of today’s large companies started as small-cap stocks. Investing in small caps can be akin to finding future industry leaders before they grow into giants. Early investment in promising small-cap stocks can lead to significant gains if these companies achieve their growth potential. Cuban’s perspective highlights the importance of identifying innovative and high-growth potential companies early in their life cycle. While the risks are considerable, the rewards for successful early investments can be substantial, making small cap investing a potentially lucrative strategy for those with a keen eye for emerging trends.\n\nInvesting in small-cap stocks can be highly rewarding, but requires a higher level of due diligence. – James Harris Simons\n\nJames Harris Simons, a renowned quantitative investor and founder of Renaissance Technologies, emphasises the need for rigorous due diligence when investing in small-cap stocks. The potential for high returns is balanced by the risks, and successful investment in small caps often involves detailed analysis and careful evaluation. Simons’ investment approach, which relies heavily on quantitative data and models, highlights the importance of thorough research in managing the complexities of small-cap investments. Investors should leverage both qualitative and quantitative methods to assess potential opportunities and mitigate risks associated with these stocks.\n\nConclusion\nSmall cap investing offers a unique blend of high risk and high reward, making it an intriguing option for those willing to delve into its complexities. The insights from renowned experts highlight the critical aspects of investing in small-cap stocks, including the necessity for patience, thorough research, and strategic management of volatility. As we’ve seen, small-cap stocks can provide substantial growth opportunities, but they require a discerning approach and careful selection to navigate their inherent risks. Balancing these investments with more stable assets and staying informed about market trends can enhance the potential for success in this dynamic segment of the market."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nIn the world of investing, constructing a well-balanced portfolio is both an art and a science. It requires not only a deep understanding of financial markets but also a disciplined approach to managing risk and maximizing returns. The wisdom of seasoned investors and financial theorists has long guided professionals and novices alike in their pursuit of financial success.\nThe following collection of quotes encapsulates some of the most profound insights on portfolio construction. These quotes offer valuable lessons on the importance of diversification, risk management, and aligning investments with personal goals. Each quote is accompanied by an explanation that delves into its significance, providing a deeper understanding of the principles that underpin successful investing.\nWhether you are an experienced investor or just beginning your financial journey, these timeless pieces of advice can help you build a portfolio that stands the test of time, weathering market fluctuations while staying on track to achieve your long-term objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversification is the only free lunch in investing. – Harry Markowitz\n\nHarry Markowitz, the father of modern portfolio theory, revolutionized investing with the idea of diversification. By spreading investments across various asset classes—such as stocks, bonds, and real estate—investors can reduce risk without sacrificing returns. This “free lunch” refers to the ability to minimize risk by not putting all your eggs in one basket, thereby mitigating the impact of any single investment’s poor performance. Diversification works because different assets often move in opposite directions under varying market conditions, balancing the overall portfolio performance and enhancing the chances of stable returns over time.\n\n\nThe essence of investment management is the management of risks, not the management of returns. – Benjamin Graham\n\nBenjamin Graham, known as the father of value investing, believed that focusing on risk management is paramount. Returns are uncertain and largely dependent on market conditions, but risk is something investors can control by carefully selecting assets, diversifying, and being cautious of overpaying for securities. Managing risk ensures that the portfolio can withstand market downturns and avoid catastrophic losses. By prioritizing risk management, investors protect their capital, making it possible to achieve long-term investment goals even if short-term returns are unpredictable or lower than expected.\n\n\nThe goal of a successful portfolio is to have a balance of risk and return, tailored to your unique goals and risk tolerance. – Suze Orman\n\nSuze Orman emphasizes the importance of aligning your investment strategy with personal financial goals and risk tolerance. A well-constructed portfolio balances growth potential and safety, ensuring that the investor can achieve their objectives—be it retirement, purchasing a home, or funding education—without taking on more risk than they are comfortable with. This balance requires understanding both the time horizon for each goal and the investor’s emotional capacity to handle market volatility. By customizing the portfolio to reflect these factors, investors can maintain confidence and stay the course through market ups and downs.\n\n\nA portfolio that is not well-diversified exposes you to unnecessary risks and limits your potential for growth. – David Swensen\n\nDavid Swensen, renowned for managing Yale’s endowment, advocated for diversification as a key strategy in reducing risk. A concentrated portfolio—where investments are limited to a few assets or sectors—can suffer severe losses if those areas underperform. By diversifying across asset classes, sectors, and geographic regions, investors can mitigate the risk of any single investment causing significant harm to their portfolio. This broader exposure not only protects against downside risk but also captures opportunities for growth across different areas, enhancing overall portfolio performance in various market conditions.\n\n\nDon’t look for the needle in the haystack. Just buy the haystack! – John C. Bogle\n\nJohn C. Bogle, founder of Vanguard and the pioneer of index funds, advocated for broad market exposure through index investing rather than trying to pick individual stocks (the needle). Index funds represent the “haystack,” capturing the performance of entire markets or sectors, thus reducing the risk associated with selecting individual winners. This approach is rooted in the belief that it’s nearly impossible to consistently outperform the market through stock picking. By buying the haystack, investors can benefit from the overall growth of the market, ensuring a diversified and low-cost investment approach with steady long-term returns.\n\n\nYour portfolio should be like a well-balanced meal, with a mix of growth, income, and stability to sustain you over the long term. – Christine Benz\n\nChristine Benz uses the metaphor of a well-balanced meal to describe a diversified portfolio. Just as a nutritious diet includes a variety of food groups, a robust portfolio should contain different types of investments to meet long-term financial needs. Growth assets (like stocks) offer the potential for capital appreciation, income assets (such as bonds) provide regular interest payments, and stability-focused investments (like cash or conservative bonds) offer protection against volatility. This mix helps investors achieve a balanced approach that supports sustained growth while managing risk, much like how a balanced diet promotes long-term health.\n\n\nSuccessful investing is about managing risk, not avoiding it. – Benjamin Graham\n\nBenjamin Graham’s wisdom highlights the importance of acknowledging and managing risk rather than attempting to avoid it altogether, which is often unrealistic in investing. All investments carry some degree of risk, but by understanding and controlling that risk—through diversification, proper asset allocation, and thorough analysis—investors can protect themselves from significant losses. This approach allows investors to stay invested through market fluctuations and capitalize on opportunities without being derailed by fear or volatility, thereby increasing the likelihood of long-term success and reaching their financial goals.\n\n\nIn portfolio construction, the objective is not to maximize returns, but to maximize the likelihood of achieving your long-term goals. – William Bernstein\n\nWilliam Bernstein, a financial theorist and author, stresses that portfolio construction should focus on achieving long-term financial goals rather than chasing maximum returns. This involves designing a portfolio that balances growth potential with risk management, ensuring that it aligns with the investor’s specific objectives, such as retirement or education funding. By focusing on goals rather than returns, investors are more likely to adopt a disciplined, patient approach, avoiding the pitfalls of speculative investing or market timing. This strategy increases the likelihood of reaching financial targets without unnecessary exposure to risk.\n\n\nBy accepting the reality of market uncertainty, a diversified portfolio allows you to weather storms and benefit from long-term growth. – Meb Faber\n\nMeb Faber, an investment strategist, emphasizes the importance of accepting market uncertainty as a constant and using diversification as a strategy to manage it. Markets are inherently unpredictable, and trying to time them can lead to poor decisions. A diversified portfolio, however, spreads investments across different assets, reducing the impact of any one market downturn. This approach not only protects the portfolio during volatile periods but also positions it to benefit from long-term growth as markets recover and different assets perform well at different times, leading to more stable overall returns.\n\n\nConstructing a portfolio is like building a house; you need a solid foundation to weather any storm. – Unknown\n\nThis analogy likens portfolio construction to building a house, where the foundation must be strong enough to support the structure during any storm. In the context of investing, this foundation is built through careful asset allocation, diversification, and risk management. Just as a house with a weak foundation might collapse during a storm, a poorly constructed portfolio may suffer significant losses during market downturns. A solid foundation in investing means having a well-thought-out strategy that can withstand market volatility, ensuring the portfolio remains resilient and capable of achieving long-term financial objectives.\n\nConclusion\nBuilding a successful investment portfolio requires more than just picking the right assets—it demands a thoughtful approach to risk management, diversification, and aligning your strategy with your long-term goals. The wisdom shared through these quotes serves as a powerful reminder that investing is a journey, not a sprint. By embracing these timeless principles, investors can navigate the complexities of the financial markets with greater confidence and resilience.\nAs you reflect on these insights, consider how they apply to your own investment decisions. Remember that a well-constructed portfolio is not just about maximizing returns, but about building a foundation that can weather market uncertainties and sustain growth over time. With the right mindset and strategies in place, you can set yourself on a path toward financial security and success."

    "title": "10 Quotes to Grasp Fixed Income Investing",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Fixed income investing is often regarded as the cornerstone of a well-balanced portfolio, providing stability and predictable returns in the face of market volatility. Unlike equities, fixed income instruments offer a promise of steady income, making them an essential tool for both conservative investors and those seeking to diversify their portfolios. As we explore this topic, we’ll draw on the wisdom of renowned financial experts, whose insights have shaped the way we think about fixed income investing. Their words serve as a reminder of the importance of discipline, knowledge, and a long-term perspective in navigating the world of bonds and other fixed income securities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Risk comes from not knowing what you’re doing.”\n– Warren Buffett\n\nWarren Buffett’s quote underscores the importance of understanding your investments, especially in fixed income. When investing in bonds or other fixed income securities, the risk is often perceived as lower compared to equities, but that doesn’t mean it’s absent. Factors like interest rate changes, credit risk, and inflation can all impact fixed income investments. Knowing these risks and how they affect your portfolio is crucial. Buffett’s advice is a reminder that successful investing, even in relatively stable assets, requires knowledge and a clear strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.”\n– Benjamin Graham\n\nBenjamin Graham’s quote is a classic in investment philosophy and applies well to fixed income investing. In the short term, bond prices can fluctuate due to market sentiment, but over time, their true value is reflected in the yield and coupon payments. Fixed income investing is about patience and long-term stability. Investors should focus on the fundamentals such as the issuer’s creditworthiness and the bond’s duration rather than getting distracted by market noise.\n\n“The four most dangerous words in investing are: ‘This time it’s different.’”\n– Sir John Templeton\n\nSir John Templeton’s cautionary statement reminds investors to be wary of the belief that historical rules no longer apply. In the context of fixed income, this is particularly important. Despite changing economic conditions, the fundamentals of bond investing—such as interest rate sensitivity and credit risk—remain consistent. Thinking that a new era has dawned where these risks no longer apply can lead to poor investment decisions. History shows that cycles repeat, and understanding past market behaviors is crucial to making informed decisions.\n\n“More money has been lost reaching for yield than at the point of a gun.”\n– Raymond DeVoe Jr.\n\nRaymond DeVoe Jr.’s quote serves as a stern warning against the temptation to chase high yields in fixed income investing. High yields often come with high risks, such as credit risk or interest rate risk. Investors may be lured by the promise of higher returns, but they must carefully assess whether the additional risk is justified. Reaching for yield without fully understanding the risks can lead to significant losses, undermining the stability that fixed income investments are supposed to provide.\n\n“An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.”\n– Benjamin Franklin\n\nBenjamin Franklin’s timeless wisdom highlights the value of education in any form of investing, including fixed income. Understanding how bonds work, the implications of interest rate changes, and the impact of economic conditions on fixed income securities can greatly enhance an investor’s ability to make sound decisions. With knowledge comes the ability to discern between a good and a bad investment, enabling investors to navigate the complexities of the bond market more effectively.\n\n“Diversification is protection against ignorance.”\n– Peter Lynch\n\nPeter Lynch’s quote about diversification is highly relevant to fixed income investing. By spreading investments across various types of bonds—government, corporate, municipal, and international—investors can reduce risk. Each type of bond reacts differently to changes in the economy, interest rates, and market conditions. Diversification allows investors to mitigate the impact of any single adverse event, thus preserving the overall stability of their portfolio. In fixed income, this principle is key to achieving a balance between risk and return.\n\n“You make most of your money in a bear market; you just don’t realize it at the time.”\n– Shelby Cullom Davis\n\nShelby Cullom Davis’s insight into bear markets offers valuable lessons for fixed income investors. During bear markets, bond prices often rise as investors flee to safety, making fixed income securities particularly attractive. While it might not seem like a time for significant gains, the stability and\nincome provided by bonds can outperform riskier assets. This quote emphasizes the importance of maintaining fixed income investments even during market downturns, as they can provide the foundation for future financial gains.\n\n“The only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.”\n– John Kenneth Galbraith\n\nJohn Kenneth Galbraith’s sardonic view of economic forecasting highlights the uncertainties inherent in predicting markets. For fixed income investors, this serves as a reminder that trying to time the market based on economic predictions can be futile. Instead, focusing on fundamentals—such as the creditworthiness of bond issuers, the duration of bonds, and the diversification of a fixed income portfolio—provides a more reliable approach to managing investments. Market timing is risky; disciplined investing is wiser.\n\n“Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it’s how we behave while we’re waiting.”\n– Joyce Meyer\n\nJoyce Meyer’s reflection on patience is especially relevant for fixed income investors. Bonds are typically long-term investments that require the investor to hold on through various market cycles. The returns may not be as immediate or as exciting as those from equities, but the steady income stream and capital preservation offered by fixed income securities reward those who are patient. This patience, coupled with disciplined investing, is crucial in achieving long-term financial goals.\n\n“The investor’s chief problem—and even his worst enemy—is likely to be himself.”\n– Benjamin Graham\n\nBenjamin Graham’s observation is a powerful reminder that the greatest challenges in investing often come from within. Emotions like fear and greed can lead to poor decisions, particularly in the realm of fixed income. During periods of low interest rates, for example, an investor might be tempted to reach for higher yields by taking on excessive risk, or panic during a market downturn and sell at a loss. Understanding and managing these emotions is key to maintaining a successful fixed income strategy.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, fixed income investing is more than just a safe haven; it is a disciplined approach that requires knowledge, patience, and a long-term perspective. The insights from these renowned figures in finance remind us that understanding risks, diversifying properly, and avoiding emotional pitfalls are key to success. While fixed income may not always be the most exciting part of an investment portfolio, it plays a crucial role in providing stability and steady returns. By adhering to these principles, investors can navigate the complexities of the bond market and achieve their financial goals.\n:::"

    "text": "Welcome to our exploration of value investing, a strategy that focuses on identifying undervalued stocks with solid fundamentals. In a world of ever-changing market trends and complex financial instruments, value investing remains a steadfast approach, rooted in long-term vision and careful analysis. Through a selection of insightful quotes from renowned experts, we will delve into the principles and philosophies that underpin this investment strategy. Each quote not only highlights a crucial aspect of value investing but also offers a glimpse into the mindset of successful investors who have navigated the financial landscape with prudence and skill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stock market is filled with individuals who know the price of everything, but the value of nothing. – Philip Fisher\n\nPhilip Fisher’s quote highlights a fundamental truth in value investing: the distinction between price and value. Price is what you pay for a stock, but value is what you get in return. Fisher’s observation underscores the importance of focusing on intrinsic value rather than being swayed by market prices, which can often be influenced by short-term sentiment. For value investors, the goal is to assess a company’s true worth based on its fundamentals, such as earnings, assets, and growth prospects, rather than reacting to daily price fluctuations. This approach requires a long-term perspective and a thorough analysis of a company’s financial health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn investing, what is comfortable is rarely profitable. – Robert Arnott\n\nRobert Arnott’s quote challenges investors to move beyond their comfort zones. In value investing, sticking to familiar investments or avoiding higher risk opportunities can often lead to mediocre returns. Arnott’s insight suggests that true profitability comes from making bold, informed decisions that might initially seem uncomfortable. This might involve investing in undervalued stocks that others overlook or taking a contrarian approach when market sentiment is overly pessimistic. Successful value investing often requires stepping outside of conventional wisdom and embracing a more analytical, sometimes uncomfortable, approach to identifying opportunities.\n\nRisk comes from not knowing what you’re doing. – Warren Buffett\n\nWarren Buffett’s quote encapsulates a core principle of value investing: understanding and knowledge mitigate risk. In value investing, thorough research and analysis are crucial. Buffett emphasizes that risk arises from a lack of understanding, not from the investment itself. By thoroughly researching a company’s financial statements, industry position, and management, investors can make informed decisions and reduce uncertainty. Buffett’s approach involves deep due diligence and a clear understanding of what one is investing in, thereby managing risk more effectively and making sound investment choices based on solid evidence rather than speculation.\n\nThe four most dangerous words in investing are: ‘This time it’s different.’ – Sir John Templeton\n\nSir John Templeton’s quote warns against the hubris of believing that current market conditions are fundamentally different from the past. This sentiment often leads investors to overlook historical patterns and make risky decisions based on optimism or short-term trends. Templeton’s advice is a reminder to adhere to proven investment principles and not be swayed by the belief that the current situation will defy historical norms. Value investing encourages a disciplined approach, focusing on long-term fundamentals rather than short-lived market phenomena, thus protecting investors from the pitfalls of overconfidence and market fads.\n\nThe best investment you can make is in yourself. – Warren Buffett\n\nWarren Buffett’s assertion that investing in oneself is paramount aligns closely with value investing principles. By acquiring knowledge and developing skills, investors enhance their ability to evaluate opportunities and make informed decisions. This personal investment can lead to better judgment and more successful investing. Buffett’s emphasis on self-improvement reflects the idea that the most valuable asset an investor can possess is a deep understanding of the market and their own investment strategies. Continuous learning and self-education empower investors to adapt to changing market conditions and identify undervalued stocks more effectively.\n\nThe investor’s chief problem—and even his worst enemy—is likely to be himself. – Benjamin Graham\n\nBenjamin Graham’s quote addresses a fundamental challenge in investing: self-discipline. Value investing relies heavily on the ability to stick to a well-researched strategy and resist emotional reactions to market fluctuations. Graham suggests that the biggest obstacle to successful investing is often one’s own behaviour—such as panic selling or greed-driven buying. Successful value investors must maintain a disciplined approach, focusing on long-term goals rather than short-term market movements. This self-control is essential for adhering to a value-oriented strategy and avoiding common psychological traps that can derail investment success.\n\nThe goal of a successful investor is to have a high probability of earning a satisfactory return. – Joel Greenblatt\n\nJoel Greenblatt’s focus on earning a satisfactory return highlights the importance of investing with a margin of safety. In value investing, this means seeking opportunities where the potential return justifies the risk involved. Greenblatt advocates for a systematic approach to identify stocks that are undervalued relative to their intrinsic worth, thereby increasing the probability of achieving a satisfactory return. This strategy involves using quantitative methods and valuation metrics to assess investment opportunities, ensuring that investors are making decisions based on solid evidence and not merely speculation.\n\nThe most important quality for an investor is temperament, not intellect. – Charlie Munger\n\nCharlie Munger’s statement underscores the role of emotional discipline in successful investing. While intelligence and analytical skills are important, Munger argues that temperament—how investors manage their emotions and make decisions under pressure—is even more critical. In value investing, maintaining a rational mindset and avoiding impulsive reactions to market volatility are crucial. Munger’s insight highlights that enduring success in investing comes from having the right attitude and emotional stability, enabling investors to stick to their strategies and make thoughtful decisions even in challenging market conditions.\n\nInvesting is not about beating others at their game. It’s about controlling yourself at your own game. – Benjamin Graham\n\nBenjamin Graham’s quote reinforces the idea that investing is a personal journey rather than a competition. Value investing is less about outperforming others and more about maintaining self-discipline and following a well-considered strategy. Graham suggests that success in investing comes from managing one’s own behaviour and sticking to personal investment principles. This perspective encourages investors to focus on their own decision-making processes and not be swayed by external pressures or comparisons with other investors. By controlling one’s own approach and staying true to a value-oriented strategy, investors can achieve long-term success.\n\nThe market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustainable optimism and unjustified pessimism. – Seth Klarman\n\nSeth Klarman’s observation about market swings between optimism and pessimism underscores the cyclical nature of financial markets. Value investors must navigate these cycles by sticking to fundamental analysis rather than getting caught up in market hype or fear. Klarman’s quote highlights the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective and focusing on intrinsic value, even when market sentiment is extreme. Understanding that market conditions are often exaggerated helps investors avoid making decisions based on transient emotions and instead focus on the underlying value of investments. This approach aligns with value investing principles by promoting resilience and a focus on long-term outcomes.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the wisdom shared by these prominent figures in value investing reveals the depth and discipline required for successful investment. From understanding the true value of investments to maintaining emotional control and sticking to long-term strategies, each quote offers valuable lessons for investors. The essence of value investing lies in thorough research, patience, and self-discipline. By embracing these principles, investors can navigate market fluctuations with confidence and achieve sustainable returns. The journey of value investing is as much about understanding oneself as it is about understanding the market, making it a deeply personal and rewarding endeavour."

    "text": "Long-term investing is a timeless strategy that has proven its worth across generations. It requires patience, discipline, and a deep understanding of the market’s inherent cycles. By focusing on long-term gains rather than short-term fluctuations, investors can build substantial wealth over time. This article delves into some of the most powerful insights from renowned thinkers and investors, offering valuable wisdom to guide you on your long-term investment journey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The stock market is designed to transfer money from the Active to the Patient.”\n– Warren Buffett\n\nWarren Buffett, one of the most successful investors of all time, emphasizes the importance of patience in long-term investing. The stock market often rewards those who are willing to wait, allowing their investments to grow over time. The concept here is that while short-term traders might be looking for quick gains, the real wealth is built by those who remain patient, letting their investments compound. This idea is supported by historical data showing that long-term investors generally outperform those who frequently trade in and out of the market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“In investing, what is comfortable is rarely profitable.”\n– Robert Arnott\n\nRobert Arnott, a pioneer in fundamental index investing, challenges investors to step out of their comfort zones. Long-term investing often involves enduring uncomfortable periods—market downturns, volatility, and uncertainty. However, these are the times when long-term investors can find the most profitable opportunities. The ability to stay invested during challenging times is crucial for reaping the benefits later, as markets tend to recover and grow over time. This mindset is essential for anyone serious about building wealth through long-term investing.\n\n“The four most dangerous words in investing are: ‘this time it’s different.’”\n– Sir John Templeton\n\nSir John Templeton, a legendary investor, warns against the mindset that new eras or trends invalidate traditional investing wisdom. Throughout history, markets have gone through various cycles of boom and bust. The belief that “this time it’s different” often leads investors to make decisions based on short-term trends rather than long-term fundamentals. This mindset can be detrimental, as it may cause investors to chase trends that are unsustainable. The key takeaway is to focus on the long-term principles that have consistently proven successful, rather than getting caught up in the hype of the moment.\n\n“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn’t, pays it.”\n– Albert Einstein\n\nAlbert Einstein’s famous quote about compound interest highlights its incredible power in the realm of long-term investing. The concept of earning interest on interest allows investments to grow exponentially over time, making it a cornerstone of wealth accumulation. This principle is particularly relevant in long-term investing, where the effects of compounding can turn modest investments into significant sums. Understanding and leveraging compound interest is crucial for any investor aiming to maximize their returns over the long haul.\n\n“Do not save what is left after spending, but spend what is left after saving.”\n– Warren Buffett\n\nWarren Buffett underscores the importance of prioritizing savings over spending. In the context of long-term investing, this mindset is critical. By saving first and investing those savings, you allow your money to work for you, growing over time through the power of compounding. This approach not only helps in building a financial cushion but also in creating wealth that can support your long-term goals. It flips the conventional approach on its head, advocating for disciplined saving and investing as the pathway to financial success.\n\n“The individual investor should act consistently as an investor and not as a speculator.”\n– Benjamin Graham\n\nBenjamin Graham, known as the father of value investing, differentiates between investing and speculating. Investing involves making decisions based on careful analysis, focusing on the long-term potential of an asset. Speculation, on the other hand, often involves taking on excessive risk in hopes of quick profits. Graham’s advice to act as an investor rather than a speculator is a foundational principle for long-term investing success. By maintaining a disciplined approach and focusing on value, investors can avoid the pitfalls of speculation and build sustainable wealth over time.\n\n“Risk comes from not knowing what you’re doing.”\n– Warren Buffett\n\n\ncontent-visible when-profile=“website_en”}\nWarren Buffett emphasizes the importance of knowledge in mitigating risk. In long-term investing, understanding the assets you are investing in is crucial. This knowledge allows you to make informed decisions and reduces the likelihood of being caught off guard by market fluctuations. The more you know about your investments, the better equipped you are to handle the inherent risks of the market. This underscores the importance of continuous learning and research in the investment process, as knowledge is a key factor in achieving long-term success.\n\n\n“The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is now.”\n– Chinese Proverb\n\nThis Chinese proverb, though simple, carries profound wisdom for long-term investors. The best time to start investing is as early as possible, allowing your investments to grow over time. However, if you haven’t started yet, the next best time is now. The idea is that it’s never too late to begin building your financial future through long-term investing. The earlier you start, the more you benefit from compounding, but even starting later in life can lead to significant gains if you remain disciplined and patient.\n\n“Time is the friend of the wonderful company, the enemy of the mediocre.”\n– Warren Buffett\n\nWarren Buffett’s quote reflects the importance of investing in quality companies for the long term. When you invest in strong, well-managed companies, time works in your favor, allowing the business to grow and compound returns. On the other hand, investing in mediocre companies often leads to disappointing results as time exposes their weaknesses. The lesson here is to focus on the quality of your investments, as the power of compounding will enhance the returns of good investments while poor investments will underperform over time.\n\n“An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.”\n– Benjamin Franklin\n\nBenjamin Franklin’s wisdom highlights the value of education and continuous learning, especially in the context of long-term investing. The more knowledgeable you are, the better your investment decisions will be. This principle applies not only to understanding financial markets but also to staying informed about broader economic trends, industries, and the companies you invest in. By investing in your own knowledge, you set yourself up for success, as informed decisions are more likely to lead to profitable outcomes in the long run.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, topic is not just a strategy but a disciplined approach to building wealth over time. As highlighted by the wisdom of renowned investors and thinkers, the keys to success in long-term investing are patience, knowledge, and the power of compounding. By adhering to these principles, you can navigate the complexities of the market and steadily work towards your financial goals. Remember, the journey of long-term investing is not about quick wins, but about creating sustainable wealth that grows over decades."

    "title": "10 Quotes to Grasp Momentum Investing",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Momentum Investing is a strategy that has intrigued and captivated investors for decades. It’s a dynamic approach that focuses on the idea that assets which have performed well in the past will continue to do so in the future. This blog post explores the nuances of momentum investing through the lens of thought leaders who have shaped the understanding of markets, investments, and trends. The following quotes provide a diverse perspective that can guide you in making informed decisions. Let’s delve into the world of momentum investing and discover what the experts have to say.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The trend is your friend until the end when it bends.”\n– Ed Seykota\n\nThis quote by Ed Seykota, a pioneer in computerised trading systems, encapsulates the essence of momentum investing. It highlights the importance of riding trends while being aware of the eventual reversal. Seykota’s approach is a cornerstone of technical analysis, where the price movement and trend lines are used to predict future price directions. The “bend” represents the point where momentum shifts, and smart investors must adapt or exit. It’s a reminder that no trend lasts forever, and understanding when to pivot is crucial in momentum investing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Momentum investing is a strategy that looks to capitalize on the continuance of existing trends in the market.”\n– Richard Driehaus\n\nRichard Driehaus, often credited as the father of momentum investing, clearly defines the strategy’s core objective. His philosophy centers around the idea that investors can profit by “buying high and selling higher,” in contrast to the traditional “buy low, sell high” approach. Driehaus believed that stocks showing strong performance are likely to continue outperforming, at least in the short to medium term. This quote underscores the forward-looking nature of momentum investing, where past performance is seen as an indicator of future success.\n\n“Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion.”\n– W. Edwards Deming\n\nW. Edwards Deming’s quote, while not directly about momentum investing, is profoundly relevant. Momentum investing relies heavily on data—historical prices, trading volumes, and other market indicators—to identify trends. This approach is grounded in the belief that data-driven decisions can outperform those based on gut feeling or speculation. In the context of momentum investing, Deming’s words remind us that rigorous analysis and data interpretation are essential in making informed investment choices that go beyond mere opinion.\n\n“Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.”\n– Warren Buffett\n\nWarren Buffett’s famous quote addresses the distinction between price and value, a concept that momentum investors must consider. While momentum investing often focuses on price trends, it’s essential not to lose sight of underlying value. A rising price doesn’t always equate to increasing value. Successful momentum investors strike a balance, ensuring that the assets they invest in also have strong fundamentals. This approach mitigates the risk of overpaying for a trend that may not be sustainable, ensuring long-term profitability.\n\n“The stock market is filled with individuals who know the price of everything, but the value of nothing.”\n– Philip Fisher\n\nPhilip Fisher’s observation highlights a common pitfall in investing: the focus on price without understanding value. In momentum investing, this can lead to chasing trends blindly. Fisher, a proponent of growth investing, believed in the importance of understanding a company’s intrinsic value. For momentum investors, this means that while it’s crucial to follow trends, it’s equally important to assess whether the price movement is backed by genuine value creation. This dual focus helps prevent investment in overhyped, unsustainable trends.\n\n“In investing, what is comfortable is rarely profitable.”\n– Robert Arnott\n\nRobert Arnott’s quote is a powerful reminder that profitable investing often requires stepping outside one’s comfort zone. Momentum investing can be uncomfortable because it involves buying into assets that have already risen in value, which can feel counterintuitive. However, as Arnott suggests, the discomfort is where the opportunity lies. The challenge is to remain disciplined and to trust the data that indicates a trend will continue. This approach often leads to higher returns, as it capitalises on the persistence of market trends.\n\n“Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.”\n– John Maynard Keynes\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes’ quote serves as a cautionary note for momentum investors. The market can behave irrationally, with prices moving in ways that defy logic or underlying fundamentals. For momentum investors, this irrationality can create both opportunities and risks. The key takeaway here is the importance of risk management. While following trends can be profitable, it’s crucial to have strategies in place to protect against sudden reversals or prolonged irrational market conditions that could lead to significant losses.\n\n“The four most dangerous words in investing are: ‘this time it’s different.’”\n– Sir John Templeton\n\nSir John Templeton’s warning reminds investors of the dangers of believing that the current market conditions are unique and will not follow historical patterns. Momentum investors can fall into this trap when they assume that a strong trend will never end. Templeton’s quote is a reminder to remain cautious and to always consider that markets are cyclical. Even the strongest trends eventually reverse, and it’s essential to remain vigilant, ensuring that one’s strategy is adaptable to changing market conditions.\n\n“The biggest risk is not taking any risk.”\n– Mark Zuckerberg\n\nMark Zuckerberg’s quote may seem unconventional in the context of investing, but it captures the essence of momentum investing. This strategy inherently involves risk, as it bets on the continuation of existing trends. Avoiding risk altogether might seem safe, but it can also mean missing out on significant opportunities. For momentum investors, the key is not to avoid risk but to manage it effectively. By embracing calculated risks, they position themselves to benefit from the strong upward movements that define successful momentum strategies.\n\n“You get recessions, you have stock market declines. If you don’t understand that’s going to happen, then you’re not ready, and you won’t do well in the markets.”\n– Peter Lynch\n\nPeter Lynch’s quote provides a reality check for all investors, including those who practice momentum investing. Market declines and economic recessions are inevitable. Momentum investors must prepare for these downturns by having a robust strategy that can withstand market volatility. Lynch’s advice is particularly relevant because it underscores the importance of understanding market cycles. By recognising that downturns are a part of investing, momentum investors can better manage their portfolios and avoid panic-driven decisions during market corrections.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, momentum investing is a powerful strategy that leverages the persistence of trends in financial markets. However, as we’ve seen through the wisdom of various financial thought leaders, success in this approach requires a careful balance of following data, understanding value, managing risk, and staying adaptable. By integrating these principles, momentum investors can navigate the complexities of the market and position themselves for long-term success. The key is to remain disciplined, always prepared for the inevitable shifts that will test the resilience of their strategies."

    "title": "Correlation of returns: why it matters, and how to analyse it with Python",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Understanding the correlation of returns between different asset classes is a key concept in finance and investment. For instance, analysing the correlation between QQQ (Nasdaq-100 ETF) and SPY (S&P 500 ETF), 2 US Equity assets, can provide critical insights into market behavior, risk assessment, and portfolio diversification. By examining their correlation, investors can make informed decisions that balance risk and return effectively.\nIn this blog post, we’ll explore the importance of correlation of returns, particularly focusing on QQQ and SPY using for this example weekly returns spanning 52 observations. Empirically, I found weekly returns to be an useful sweet spot between data quality, stability and number of estimation points.\nWe’ll also delve into the core concepts, key formulas, and provide a comprehensive set of Python examples using various libraries. Let’s get started!\n\n\n\nThe correlation of returns measures the degree to which two securities move in relation to one another.\nThere are different approaches to estimate it, but one usually relies on the so-called Spearman correlation coefficient. Its fundamental formula for correlation is:\nCorrelation Formula \\[\n\\rho(X\\,Y)=\\frac{Cov(X, Y)}{\\sigma_X\\,\\sigma_Y}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\rho(X, Y)\\) is the correlation coefficient between asset X and asset Y.\n\\(Cov(X, Y)\\) is the covariance between the returns of assets X and Y.\n\\(\\sigma_X\\) is the standard deviation of asset X’s returns.\n\\(\\sigma_Y\\) is the standard deviation of asset Y’s returns.\n\n\n\n\nCovariance (\\(Cov(X, Y)\\)): Indicates how two variables move together.\nStandard Deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)): Measures the volatility or risk associated with a given security.\n\n\n\n\nThis formula results in a correlation coefficient ranging from -1 to 1.\nThere are 3 idealized values:\n\n+1: Perfect positive correlation\n-1: Perfect negative correlation\n0: No correlation\n\nUnderstanding these parameters helps us derive insightful conclusions on the correlation of returns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing the price history over the long term can help identify trends and significant events impacting both QQQ and SPY ETFs. We’ll use the yfinance library to fetch historical data and matplotlib for plotting.\n\n\nCode\nimport yfinance as yf\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Fetch data\nqqq = yf.Ticker('QQQ')\nspy = yf.Ticker('SPY')\n\nqqq_hist = qqq.history(period='max', interval='1wk')\nspy_hist = spy.history(period='max', interval='1wk')\n\nspy_hist = spy_hist.reindex(qqq_hist.index)\n# Plotting price history\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(qqq_hist.index, qqq_hist['Close'], label='QQQ')\nax.plot(spy_hist.index, spy_hist['Close'], label='SPY')\nax.set_title(\"Price History of QQQ and SPY\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"Date\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Price\")\nax.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving retrieved uncharted the price of QQQ SPY, it’s now time to look at their returns. There is a very handy function pct_change() in the pandas library That enables us to convert directly price time series 2 return timeseries.\nAs our price timeseries is already in weekly frequency, we can directly use pct_change() to get the weekly returns and plot them using matplotlib.\n\n\nCode\nqqq_hist['Return'] = qqq_hist['Close'].pct_change()\nspy_hist['Return'] = spy_hist['Close'].pct_change()\n\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.bar(qqq_hist.tail(104).index, qqq_hist['Return'].tail(104), label='QQQ')\nax.bar(spy_hist.tail(104).index, spy_hist['Return'].tail(104), label='SPY')\nax.set_title(\"Weekly Returns for QQQ and SPY\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"Date\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Weekly Return\")\nax.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the chart above, we can see that the QQQ ETF delivers much higher returns, on the upside and on the downside. From a correlation perspective we can see that when spy is up, QQQ is up to often higher, but overall, they typically evolve in the same direction. As you can guess, this probably indicates a high level of coalition between these two assets. .\nIt’s time to look at a more precise way to analyse every returns.\n\n\n\nIndeed, the histogram is an excellent tool to visualize the distribution of weekly returns for each ETF. It aids in understanding the frequency and volatility associated with the returns. Went to distribution are plotted one on top of the other, it becomes very easy to compare the two distributions.\nAs you can see below, The distribution of the spy etf is much more narrow compared to QQQ which is a confirmation of the quick insights which caome from the previous chart.\n\n\nCode\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.hist(qqq_hist['Return'].dropna(), bins=30, alpha=0.5, label='QQQ')\nax.hist(spy_hist['Return'].dropna(), bins=30, alpha=0.5, label='SPY')\nax.set_title(\"Distribution of Weekly Returns\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"Weekly Return\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Frequency\")\nax.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating rolling volatility (standard deviation of returns) over a specified period (e.g., 52 weeks) assists in identifying periods of high or low market uncertainty for both ETFs.\n\n\nCode\nqqq_hist['Rolling_Vol'] = qqq_hist['Return'].rolling(window=52).std() * (52**0.5) * 100\nspy_hist['Rolling_Vol'] = spy_hist['Return'].rolling(window=52).std()* (52**0.5) * 100\n\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(qqq_hist.index, qqq_hist['Rolling_Vol'], label='QQQ Volatility')\nax.plot(spy_hist.index, spy_hist['Rolling_Vol'], label='SPY Volatility')\nax.set_title(\"Rolling Volatility of QQQ and SPY (annualised, in %)\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"Date\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Volatility (in %)\")\nax.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo visually understand the relationship between the weekly returns of QQQ and SPY, a scatter plot is effective. We’ll add a best-fit line to see the correlation.\n\n\nCode\nfrom scipy.stats import linregress\n\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.scatter(qqq_hist['Return'], spy_hist['Return'], alpha=0.5, label='Weekly Returns')\n\n# Best fit line\nslope, intercept, r_value, p_value, std_err = linregress(qqq_hist['Return'].dropna(), spy_hist['Return'].dropna())\nax.plot(qqq_hist['Return'], intercept + slope*qqq_hist['Return'], 'r', label=f'Best fit line (R^2={r_value**2:.2f})')\n\nax.set_title(\"Scatter Plot of Weekly Returns\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"QQQ Weekly Returns\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"SPY Weekly Returns\")\nax.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo visually understand the relationship between the weekly returns of QQQ and SPY, it might be useful to look at how the correlation itself evolves across time. That’s where a rolling window correlation might help.\n\n\nCode\nqqq_hist['Rolling_Vol'] = qqq_hist['Return'].rolling(window=52).corr(other=spy_hist['Return'])\n\nplt.style.use('getting_started-chart.mplstyle')\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(qqq_hist.index, qqq_hist['Rolling_Vol'], label='QQQ vs SPY Correlation (52 Weeks)')\nax.set_title(\"Rolling Correlation of QQQ and SPY\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"Date\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Correlation\")\nax.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the correlation between QQQ and SPY is valuable for making informed portfolio decisions. It aids in the diversification, risk management, and insight into market trends.\nWhile correlation is a powerful tool, it comes with limitations:\n\nIt relies on historical data which may not reflect future market conditions,\nIt assumes a linear relationship,\nIt sometimes oversimplifies the relationship between assets.\n\nNevertheless, calculating and visualising correlation helps in understanding market dynamics and improving investment strategies.\nIf you are curious to learn more, check out these resources:\n\nInvestopedia on Correlation\nQuantStart on Financial Time Series\n\nTo see this tutorial in action, don’t miss the video on our Data Driven Minutes Youtube channel.

Moreover, I am typically looking Long Term Investing, and as such, Indices, diversified portfolio or ETFs are in focus for me.\nSpeaking about asset classes, we need some ETFs to analyse!\n\n“Important: Please bear in mind this article if purely for pedagogical purpose and should by no mean be understood as a recommendation or advice. Investing brings risk and in particular risk of loss of capital. I have no intention to recommend anything! I will follow among others this recent article in US News{% fn 7%} and ETF.com{% fn 8%} as sources of inspiration to identify relevant ETFs.”\n\n\nEquity\nLet’s start with various Equity sub-asset classes:\n\nIVV: iShares Core S&P 500 ETF representing US Equity Large Cap\nSCHA: Schwab U.S. Small-Cap ETF representing US Equity Small Cap\nIJH: iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF representing US Equity Mid Cap\nSCHD: Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF representing US Equity Dividend (ie US stocks which are deemed to pay higher dividends)\nVTI: Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF representing US Equity, with all market cap included\nVXUS: Vanguard Total International Stock ETF representing World ex-US equities\nEEM: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF representing the Emerging Market Equities\n\n\n\nFixed Income\nLet’s add Fixed Income, which would typically aim to reduce the overall portfolio’s volatility:\n\nAGG: iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETFrepresenting the entire US Bond market\nGOVT: iShares U.S. Treasury Bond ETF representing the performance of US Government Bonds\nVCLT: Vanguard Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF representing the Investment Grade USD denominated bonds.\n\n\n\nAlternative Assets\nLet’s add 2 additional asset classes, Gold and Commodities:\n\nGLD: SPDR Gold Trust representing the price of **Gold\nPDBC: Invesco Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF** which will represent the performance of the Broad Commodities asset class\n\nEverything in the above is denominated in US Dollars, this will make our life easier in what follows, ie we will not need any currency conversion, which is always a bit painful in the process."

    "text": "Estimate risk and return\nIn Markowitz 1952, the optimal portfolio is obtained as a function of expected returns and expected risks of the portfolio. This takes a strong assumption that we have a “crystal ball”, or at least access to a predictive model, which at this stage is well beyond this article.\nFor this first example, we will rely on historical parameters estimation, which precisely means that we expect the past to be a good prediction of what might happen in the future.\n\nVolatility\nThere are many ways to estimate the volatility, and I will only cover the simplest approach.\nWe have access to daily close prices of the ETFs, hence we could look at the standard deviation of daily returns. In theory this would utilise most of the data we have access to, which is a good thing. In practice, and especially when looking at asset classes which can be observed with an 8 to 12 hours time difference which might lead the “sample volatility” to become inconsistent between 2 asset classes. This is even more important for estimating the correlation.\nPractitioners often use weekly returns to alleviate this issue, and we will do the same here, and as such calculate the returns using a resampled time series. To calculate the annualized volatility requires an additional factor in this case the square root of 52. Why this?\nVolatility is essential to option traders, and when pricing options, practitioners often model asset prices as Wiener processes(number of weeks in a year) 3. The variance of a Wiener process is proportional to the time, and the volatility is the square root of the the variance, which gives us that to convert standard deviation of weekly returns into an annualized figure, we need to multiply our results by the square root of the number of weeks in a year.\n\n\nCode\nweekly_returns = df.resample(\"W\").last().pct_change()\n((weekly_returns.std()*math.sqrt(52)*100).sort_values()).plot.bar();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs one could have guessed, on the left of the chart above, we can find the low volatility asset classes (e.g. Government Bonds, Investment Grade Bonds), whereas on the right we have high volatility asset classes (Mid Cap and Small Cap Equities)."
